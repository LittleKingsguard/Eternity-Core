Some Assets or Talents may be Overt-Use, and do not passively impact Stealth, but cause any Action using them to be Overt. Explosives, firearms, and fire effects tend to be Overt-Use.

The passive Reaction to detect an Overt-Use Action occurs after the Action has resolved. If a character Reacts actively, the roll applies twice: once normally, before the Action, and once Upgraded, after the Action.

Design Notes:
Unlike normal Reactions, the Discover attempt takes place after the Action to prevent the case where breaking the character's Stealth allows them to Oppose the Action normally, even if the acting character was previously Undetected. This would allow cases like dodging an unseen sniper's bullet, after it was fired, because the target heard the shot.
