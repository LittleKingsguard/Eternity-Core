Some Assets are automatically Overt, such as large or flashy pieces of Gear, a particularly (in)famous Reputation or Appearance, or some Ascended Abilities. Merely possessing them does not ruin Stealth, but any attempt to gain Stealth has a starting D/R/Tier equal to its Bonus. Similarly, attempting to enter a Scene in Stealth with such an Asset costs Agency and Impact equal to 1 + Tier.
