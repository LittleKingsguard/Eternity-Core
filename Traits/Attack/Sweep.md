A Sweep Attack may target any number of characters in reach (usually Engaged), in an order of the attackerâ€™s choice. The same roll is used for all targets. However, if any damage is dealt after Oppose Reactions or if a character mitigates it with a Parry, that much Power is reduced from the roll against all subsequent targets.
