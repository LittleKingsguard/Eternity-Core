A Splash Attack is inherently Lethal or otherwise has its damage raised through Tier. Additionally, it Attacks with non-Lethal damage to all Characters within the next largest area in the progression. 

This includes the original target, if the main attack missed. They can avoid this by spending a Tier from their Reaction, or mitigate it with any remaining Power.
