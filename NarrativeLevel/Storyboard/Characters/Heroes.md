Heroes are the "main characters" of the story, and each player should have one.

The default assumption for starting Heroes is as Tier I characters, and that they are all aware of and allied to each other.

Design Notes:
While the default assumption is that the player characters are, in fact, heroic and well-intentioned in their struggle with more villainous Adversaries, this is not a requirement. "Heroes" is merely a convenient shorthand.
More importantly, the assumption that the heroes are all cooperating is accounted for in the balancing of the "party" of heroes as a whole vs. the individually stronger Adversaries, and if the heroes are working towards cross purposes, either the number of Adversaries or the power gap between them and the Heroes should be diminished.
