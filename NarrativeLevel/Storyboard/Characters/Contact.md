Characters have Contact with each other if their most recent Scene ended with both Concealed or out of Stealth entirely. This lasts until one character enters a Scene that does not involve the other character, or one character ends a Scene Hidden or Undetected by the other. Characters may also voluntarily stay in Contact if they have the ability to communicate with each other.

If characters are in Contact, they may always choose to join Scenes the other is particiapting in, or initiate Scenes targeting the other character, barring other restrictions like a Restricted or Private Location. Characters in Contact with each other cannot be Undetected from each other starting a Scene, and are instead Hidden. They also start with a Lead on the other's starting position when entering the Scene, or may simply choose to communicate their exact starting position to each other.
