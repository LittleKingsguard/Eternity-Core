Characters have Contact with each other if their most recent Scene had both present and aware of each other. This lasts until one character enters a Scene that does not involve the other character, or they Break Contact. Characters may also voluntarily stay in Contact if they have the ability to communicate with each other. A character may Break Contact as a Dilemma on a Conflict Action.

If characters are in Contact, they may choose to join Scenes the other is particiapting in, or initiate Scenes targeting the other character.
