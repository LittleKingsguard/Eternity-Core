Extras are the minor characters who don't take any active role in the plot, but are important enough to be recurring characters. Extras only end up in a Scene if they are targeted or if a Hero or Adversary pulls them in as an Ally or other Asset.

When pulled into a Scene, Extras use Minion rules for characters, with Dice/Power related to their Asset bonus, even if the Asset they represent wouldn't normally be a Minion (ex. Connections).

Players may spend Ascension Tokens to define new aspects of the character, such as Intimacies or Locations they visit, or, once at the end of each Scene they participate in, to raise either their Dice or Power by 1.

An Extra's APA and SPA tracks behave as normal for characters, but as Minions they do not have an NPA track, and if they would take NPA damage they are removed from the story immediately.
