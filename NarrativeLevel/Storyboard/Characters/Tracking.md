A character may choose to Track another character if they are Hidden or Undetected by the target character when the target leaves a Scene. This lasts until the target character enters a Scene that the other character does not follow them into, the target character Breaks Contact, or establishes Contact on the tracker.

The tracking character may always choose to initiate a Scene targeting the Tracked character, or Join a Scene they participate in.
