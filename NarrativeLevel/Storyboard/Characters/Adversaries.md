Adversaries are the antagonists to the Heroes' protagonists, under the control of the GM (for GM-centric play) or a different player at the table (for full-table play) from their "main opponent's" player.

The Adversaries for a new game under the default starting rules are Tier II characters, but do *not* cooperate, have any non-Public information about the other characters, and work at least partially towards cross purposes. There should be one Adversary for each Hero, and each one should have an objective and/or Intimacies that push them towards conflict with at least one Hero and at least one other Adversary.

Design Notes:
Adversaries are meant to be significantly more powerful than Heroes, and confronting one directly is intended to be framed more as a group boss fight than a reasonable individual challenge. This is meant as a balance against the Adversaries individually being solo opponents, or only backed up by their own Minions. 

Additionally, particularly in the early Acts, the expected primary opponent of Adversaries is, in fact, *other Adversaries*, as they start with no knowledge of the Heroes' involvement by default. This gives the Heroes time to narrow the gap with the Adversaries in power, and weakens the Adversaries overall.

Finally, the assumption that the Adversaries are taking the active, driving role in the plot and the Heroes (and possibly other Adversaries) are reacting to stop them is again to the Heroes' benefit, because of the lower cost of Joining Scenes vs. Initating Scenes, and the need to succeed vs. preventing success.

If changing any of these assumptions (outside of certain Hero traits, ex. Nemesis Flaw), the number of Adversaries should be reduced for each such change.
