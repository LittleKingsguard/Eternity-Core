The Storyboard is composed of all of the game and narrative elements that persist across multiple scenes, including characters and setting details. While there should be a board for the whole table to show all publicly known information about different characters, locations, and challenges, players are encouranged to keep additional ones for their own characters to track any secret information their characters discover.
