Storyboard-level Obstacles represent major barriers that limit character's options when starting Scenes and between Scenes. This may restrict players from starting Scenes in certain Locations until the Obstacle is overcome/bypassed/destroyed, block them from benefiting from or gaining certain Roles or Assets, or represent a Preliminary Objective for a character.
