Storyboard-level Crises represent major threats that will cause major harm to one or more characters, jeopardize Storyboard-level Projects or Objectives, or otherwise make significant changes to the setting as a whole. Quelling a Crisis may often be a preliminary Objective, and characters can instigate new ones against rivals as a Complicate Goal.
