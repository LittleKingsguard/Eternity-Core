Powers are the overarching authorities and untouchable entities that have command of the setting, such as governments, major churches, megacorps, cartels, and so on, or even simply the vox populi. The Powers exist, but they are assumed to have better things to be doing than involving themselves in the narrative of their own accord. However, they define what actions are considered Offenses, and any consequences of Offenses answer to their authority.
