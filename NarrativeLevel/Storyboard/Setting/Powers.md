Powers are the overarching authorities and untouchable entities that have command of the setting, such as governments, major churches, megacorps, cartels, and so on, or even simply the vox populi. The Powers exist, but they are assumed to have better things to be doing than involving themselves in the narrative of their own accord. However, their presence may be significant in terms of Assets (ex. government contacts, financial backers) or as part of a looming Crisis (a government manhunt for a character accused of crimes).
