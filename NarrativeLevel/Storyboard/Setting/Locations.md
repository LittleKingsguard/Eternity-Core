Locations are the setpieces for Scenes, and when starting a Scene, the player must either choose an existing Location their character knows about and has access to, or introduce a new one.

Additionally, some Assets, like Capital and Lifestyle Assets, have fixed Locations by default. When creating such an Asset, having a map available for any Focus Scenes started in it is preferred.

A Location can be Public or Secret.
If a location is public, all characters know about it, or, if it is controlled by another character or only relevant due to Secret actions or Assets of another character, all other characters that have identified the owner. 
If a Location is Secret, the Location must be discovered specifically though Investigation.

Only characters that know about the Location (or at least, why it's important) can start Scenes in that Location, or Join Scenes without Tracking or Contact with characters already present.

They may also be Private or Restricted. 
A Private Location is controlled by a character, and Starting or Joining a Scene there without the permission of the owning character is usually an Offense, and may invoke any Security traits attached to any Assets present in the Location.
A Restricted Location is controlled by a Power or other outside party, and has some list of requirements for access, such as a bank only opening the vaults for clients or particularly weathy potential clients. Entering a Scene without meeting these requirements is *always* an Offense, and they always have significant guards or other security. 

A Location may also be Secluded. Overt Actions that occur in a Secluded Location do not get revealed at the end of the Scene. However, any consequences during the Scene, such as the passive Investigate rolls for going Overt in Stealth, still occur. Additionally, Powers will not react to Offenses committed at Secluded Locations, though other characters may still Investigate them for their normal effect.
