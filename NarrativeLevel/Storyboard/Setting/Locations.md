Locations are the setpieces for Scenes, and when starting a Scene, the player must either choose an existing Location their character knows about and has access to, or introduce a new one.

Additionally, some Assets (ex. houses, companies, etc,) have fixed Locations by default.

Only characters that know about the Location (or at least, why it's important) can start Scenes in that Location, or Join Scenes without Tracking or Contact with characters already present.
