At the start of each Act, each player chooses the Priority for their character.

Design Notes:
The Narrative-level Act and the Scene-level Round largely follow the same basic structure, with the names of different elements changed to avoid confusion, ex. Spotlight and Action Points both play the same role in their respective frameworks, as a metacurrency for tracking the number of things a character can do during the Act or Round.
