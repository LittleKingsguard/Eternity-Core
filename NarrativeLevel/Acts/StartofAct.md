At the start of each Act, each character chooses a Primary and Supporting Ability they wish to favor for the duration of the Act, and the associated Roles.
For the two selected, take the Finesse Rating from each pair. 
These two determine the amount of Spotlight the character has for instigating or joining scenes as normal for derivative values, i.e. starting Spotlight is equal to the Primary Finesse Rating. 
They may at any later time Exert themselves for additional Spotlight, taking SPA damage point-for-point, up to the soft cap, i.e. both Action Abilities combined.

This is then repeated with the Force half of the above pairs to get the characterâ€™s starting and maximum Resources for the turn.

Design Notes:
The Narrative-level Act and the Scene-level Round largely follow the same basic structure, with the names of different elements changed to avoid confusion, ex. Spotlight and Action Points both play the same role in their respective frameworks, as a metacurrency for tracking the number of things a character can do during the Act or Round.

One significant difference between starting an Act and starting a Round is that for Scenes, the Primary Ability used for establishing AP/Effort is determined by the nature of the Scene and what is expected to happen based on the Goals established. As the Narrative lacks a higher-level structure to give it definition, players instead chose these Abilities based on how competent the character is at those Abilities and the Roles they want to have for the Act.
