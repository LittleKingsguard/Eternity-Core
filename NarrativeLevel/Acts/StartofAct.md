At the start of each Act, each character chooses any two of their Ability Groups (Physical, Mental, Social, Persistence, etc.). 
For the two selected, take the Action Ability (DEX, INT, MNP, LCK) from each pair. 
The higher of these two is the amount of starting Spotlight the character has for instigating or joining scenes. 
They may at any later time Exert themselves for additional Spotlight, taking SPA damage point-for-point, up to a Spotlight total equal to both of the above abilities combined.

This is then repeated with the Effort half of the above pairs (STR, LRN, CHA, WILL) to get the characterâ€™s starting and maximum Resources for the turn.
