Roles are powerful bonuses the player may choose based on the Abilities they use to determine a character's Spotlight/Resources for the duration of an Act.
Each character has three Roles: one Primary Role, which must be chosen from the available options from their Primary Ability chosen for the Act, and two Secondary Roles, one from each chosen Ability Group.
The chosen Roles remain active for the duration of the Act.

Design Notes:
Roles, especially Primary Roles, are intended to be very powerful effects that do not come in to play in all Scenes.
One of the motivations behind this is to provide an incentive for players to do something other than choose their two strongest Abilities every time, and by extension provide a balancing factor in favor of generalist characters that can adapt their Roles based on the opportunities in the story without crippling their action economy. They also provide a way for players whose characters are not active participants in the Scene to stay involved, through passive join effects.
Additionally, it provides a signal and incentive towards starting the sort of Scenes that play to the character's chosen Role.
