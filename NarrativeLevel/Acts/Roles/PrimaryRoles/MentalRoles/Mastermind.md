If the Mastermind spends a Scene making Preparations, Scheming, or advancing a Project, and no opponent joins the Scene, the results of the Scene are not Overt, even if the normally would be, or, if this is implausible, they at least have no Overt connection to it. The Mastermind may also delay the results until after another character resolves a Scene, framing that character for the results.
