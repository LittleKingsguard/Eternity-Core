The Investigator may passively join any Scene they are aware of and have access to "after the fact". Due to not actually being in the same place and the same time, they can generally only take Investigate Actions and Reactions, and likewise other characters cannot directly interact with them except to attempt to deceive them by concealing or planting evidence.

Design Notes:
The Investigator's *player* should be participating in the Scene as it transpires, investigating in real-time and making liberal use of flash-backs and flash-forwards.
