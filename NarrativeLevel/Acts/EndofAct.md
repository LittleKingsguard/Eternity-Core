The Act ends when all characters have taken their turn and none are willing or able to start a new Scene by spending Spotlight.

First, any remaining Delay effects that were meant to trigger during this Act take effect, in descending order of Priority.
Then, any Narrative-level crises or similar end-of-Act effects trigger.
If specific order would matter in either case, the players of any instigating charcters can decide or settle it by contested roll.

Finally, all remaining active characters Recover SPA.
