At the start of each Act, after gaining Spotlight/Resources, all character may spend Spotlight on increasing their Priority.

Priority decides the turn order for starting Scenes, and characters take penalties to Agency/Impact when joining Scenes started by characters with higher Priority.

Design notes:
Priority is mechanically identical to Initiative, only differing in that it exists in the Narrative level.
