At the start of each Act, after gaining Spotlight, all character may spend Spotlight on increasing their Priority.
After all characters have done so, Priority starts at the highest score among all characters. 
At the first Priority count, any characters at that count take their turn. The Priority count is then decremented by 1.

On all subsequent counts, all characters with a higher Priority may, in descending order of Priority, choose to start a new Scene by spending SP. 
After this, play continues to any characters at that count, as above.

A character cannot start more than one Scene on the same Priority count. If more than one character has the same Priority, the players may choose their order. 

If a character Joins a Scene during a higher Priority count than their own, they lose Agency and Impact equal to the difference (this cannot reduce them to 0).

Design notes:
Priority is mechanically identical to Initiative, only differing in that it exists in the Narrative level.
