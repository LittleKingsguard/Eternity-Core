Resources (RS) are gained at the start of each Act, derived from the Act's chosen Force Ratings. The total can be raised up to the soft cap by spending SPA on a point-for-point basis.

Resources represent "off-screen" materiel not important enough to be represented by Assets, reserves of strength or focus, or other things the character can draw from to push extra effort and emphasis into a Scene.
By spending 1 RS, the character can increase the Agency or Impact invested into a Goal by 2.
Similarly, they may increase the Agency or Impact spent on Bonuses by 2.

Design Notes:
Following the general pattern of Acts mirroring Rounds, Resources is a Narrative-level counterpart to Effort.
