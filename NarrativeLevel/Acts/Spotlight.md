Spotlight (SP) is gained at the start of each Act, derived from the Finesse Ratings of the Act's chosen Abilities. The total can be raised up to the soft cap by spending SPA on a point-for-point basis.

Spotlight is used for joining Scenes started by other characters, or for starting additional Scenes after the one free Scene each character gets on their turn. It is also used for buying Priority at the start of each Act.
Each point of Priority costs 1 SP.
Joining a Scene costs 1 SP, plus any extra to negate Blitz penalties from the starting character having higher Priority.
Starting a new Scene costs 2 SP.

Design Notes:
Spotlight is mechanically identical to Action Points (AP), only at the Narrative level.
