Spotlight (SP) is gained at the start of each Act. Each character gets an amount of SP equal to the number of players. The total can be raised up to double by spending Overload on a point-for-point basis.

Spotlight is used for joining Scenes started by other characters, or for starting additional Scenes after the one free Scene each character gets on their turn. It is also used for buying Priority at the start of each Act.
Each point of Priority costs 1 SP.
Joining a Scene costs 1 SP.
Starting a new Scene costs 2 SP.

Design Notes:
Spotlight is mechanically identical to Action Points (AP), only at the Narrative level.
