Eternity does not insist upon a linear flow of time with regards to actions and scenes being declared, and it is possible for one Scene to have characters participate in entirely different points in time *in-universe* while actions are declared by the players concurrently. A Scene could, for example, have one character committing a crime at night, while another character is investigating the crime scene the following morning. Both players (or a player and the GM) follow normal Initiative rules and act accordingly. They may even take Actions against each other, as long as the players can justify how they are targeting a character that isn't present in the Scene with them, such as examining evidence left by their opponent, or leaving a deadly "surprise" for a future pursuer.

However, once a detail has been established, it cannot be retconned later. For example, a piece of evidence discovered at the start of a scene cannot later be cleaned up, even if the criminal finds themselves with time to kill later in the Scene. Depending on the flow of the Scene, however, they could use an [Frame-Up Action](https://github.com/LittleKingsguard/Eternity-Core/blob/29d663ee81a37d951854dc0e742c1b7d567e9283/Systems/Conflict/Investigate/Frame-Ups.md) to claim what was *actually* discovered  was *fake* evidence that frames someone else, as long as it doesn't contradict any details previously established.
