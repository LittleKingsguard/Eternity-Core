#Base Values
Base Values are any fundamental rating of a character, asset, project, obstacle, or other element. Examples include the Ability ratings of a character, the Dice/Power bonuses of an Asset, or the Difficulty/Resistance of a challenge.
Base Values as a category do not have a hard cap, though most subtypes have their own limits.
