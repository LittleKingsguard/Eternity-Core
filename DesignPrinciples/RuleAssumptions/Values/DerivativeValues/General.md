All derivative values (ex. the amount of Dice/Power for an Action, the amount of Spotlight/AP a character can spend in a round, etc.) use two base values to determine its starting point, soft cap, and hard cap.
If the value has only one related base value (ex. the Dice rating for Minions), it is used twice for this purpose (i.e. a Minion with a Dice rating of X starts all relevant Actions with X Dice, has a soft cap of 2X, and a hard cap of 4X).
If the value has more than two related base values, use the two highest.
