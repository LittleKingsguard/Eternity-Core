The Hard Cap is twice the value of the Soft Cap, being double the total of both Abilities defining the value in question. This includes any points from this value that have been spent, as with AP, Spotlight, Resources, or Effort, or Dice or Power spent to add other modifiers to an Action.

**The Hard Cap is an absolute line, and cannot be exceeded under any circumstances.**
