If an effect would translate Dice/Agency to Successes or Difficulty without involving a roll (ex. Reactions, setting the difficulty of created challenges), half of the dice are converted to Successes.

If an effect would allow dice to be transformed into Successes as an option before rolling, the ratio is instead three dice per Success.
