If a player starts or Joins an entire Scene or Narrative-level Project based on Intimacies or Flaws, in the same manner as an Actions may earn Ascension Tokens, the character is eligible for an Eternity Mark. If the Scene is not inherently self-destructive or suicidal (ex. openly confronting an Adversary alone, in their field of greatest strength), upgrading all Goal Minions/Crises/Obstacles is a suitable representation of the terrible decision-making involved.

Success or failure doesn’t matter; as long as the character puts forth a good-faith effort to uphold the Intimacies or Flaws that got them into this situation and survives, they gain an Eternity Mark. (If survival was never in doubt, it’s worth revisiting the question of whether it was worth an Eternity Mark at all.)

Each Mark a character has is a crucible of experience and resolve, and every subsequent Action or Reaction gains a +1 Floating Bonus, as a result of this trial by fire. Additionally, when part of a similar, if less dangerous or self-destructive Scene, one Action or Reaction (per Mark) can be upgraded by one Tier, as the character applies lessons their experience has taught them.

Many Flaws that can affect the Narrative level likewise give the character opportunities to earn an Eternity Mark by either overcoming them, or giving in at the worst of times.

Design Notes:
Eternity Marks serve the same purpose as Ascension Tokens, but on a grander scale.
