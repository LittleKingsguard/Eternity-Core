If a player chooses an Action for a character based on the character’s Intimacies despite said Action being clearly disruptive to their long-term plans, unnecessarily dangerous, or otherwise something the player understands is clearly a bad idea, they immediately gain one Ascension Token. 

Similarly, many Flaws give Ascension Tokens when the player decides they are relevant and invokes them.

A Token can be spent on any Action or Reaction at any point during the process, including after the roll, to raise the result by one Tier, as the player describes how environmental factors, random coincidence, a lucky flute of skill, or other quirks of fate conspire to make the attempt far more successful than it otherwise would have been. The nature of how a Token affects the Action means any Spillover it causes through the Tier increase cannot be negated. A Token can be spent on the same Action that earned it, and only one can be spent per attempt.

Design Notes:
Ascension Tokens are the “carrot” the system uses to encourage roleplay, particularly the non-optimized play that turns characters into scheme-disrupting agents of chaos.
As a rule of thumb, the mistakes made during the Action (or non-Action) that grants them the token should take them 2-4 similar-Tier Actions to recover from, assuming they have the time and ability to do so at all.
