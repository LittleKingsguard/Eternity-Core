Eternity Ascendant is “Fiction First”, here meaning that the player describes the Action they want their character to attempt or invents a Goal they wish to add into the Scene based on the limits and themes established by the story, and then the table or GM decides on the best way to model that Action or Goal using the mechanics and systems in this document.

For example, an ordinary man attempting to attack a warship with a dinner knife is unlikely to actually damage anything meaningful, but it might serve to distract the crew. Thus, instead of the Physical Attack using a knife would usually be, it would instead be rolled as a Social Attack on the crew, and presenting them with a Dilemma vs. Distraction.

That said, Eternity Ascendant is intended to err on the permissive side, and permit experienced characters to accomplish things unimaginable to an ordinary man. A character capable of Tier 4 actions in their own right might absolutely be able to destroy a ship with a butter knife.

With that in mind, here are some base rules of thumb for deciding on actions:
* If the player can’t explain how the action could reasonably result in the effect they want, pick a different action.
* If the player can’t explain how they’re interfering during a Reaction, the character can’t React.
* If the player can’t explain how a Talent, feature of equipment, or other effect is relevant to the action, they don’t get the effect.
