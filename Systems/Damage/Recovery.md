While time eventually heals all wounds (End of Round, above), characters may actively Recover plot armor by way of doing some Action to reverse whatever effect caused the damage. While this will often need to be a separate Action to ex. Perform first aid, depending on how damage was taken other Actions might Recover as a side effect. For example, if PCs have taken damage from Exertion on Resource talents, a scene ending with the PCs having secured a large amount of money may Recover that damage.
