Dilemmas are a mechanism for “negotiating” resolutions to Conflict scenes and actions other than outright damage. When a character is faced with a Dilemma, the player is given the option to take it as damage, or instead accept a Status applied to the character or a change in their motivations, loyalties, ties, assets, or constraints on their future actions and scenes. If the player declines the damage, the Dilemma remains, with the associated damage noted. The player can later accept the condition imposed by the Dilemma if circumstances change and immediately regain the lost PA.

If the character clears a PA track that has damage from a Dilemma, this removes the Dilemma if the associated damage is already affecting the minimum PA track required for the intended effect. Otherwise, the PA paid on the next highest track is associated with the Dilemma. The player may choose to submit to the Dilemma before clearing the PA track, if this would erase enough damage to avoid having to clear it.
