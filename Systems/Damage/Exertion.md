Characters may Exert themselves to spend additional AP or Effort as above or use certain Talents. Each point of Exertion deals one point of damage to the Action track, with no opportunity for reduction. If the character Exerts for extra Spotlight or Resources, or invokes certain Talents out-of-Scene at the Narrative level or while starting or joining a Scene, the damage instead goes to the Scene track.
