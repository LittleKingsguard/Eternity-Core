When a character is affected by a Conflict Action, suffers from a Hazard, takes Consequences from a failed attempt on an Obstacle or Crisis, refuses a Dilemma, or otherwise suffers harm, they take Distraction/Stress, or spend Plot Armor (PA) to protect themselves. By default, a damage source causes Distraction. If the source's Tier is greater than the character's Defense Tier, a Tier may be spent to increase this to Stress, or two further Tiers to increase Stress to Plot Armor, as long as the remaining Tiers are equal or greater than the Defense Tier.

Design notes:
The term Plot Armor is used in place of "hit points" or similar terms to make clear that damage does not necessarily represent injuries or wounds. Rather, spending Plot Armor on damage lets the player justify near misses, flukes of luck, emergency backup armor, or whatever other excuse the player can come up with for surviving attacks, resisting influence, ducking investigations, and so on.
