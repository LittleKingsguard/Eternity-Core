When a character is affected by a Conflict Action, suffers from a Hazard, takes Consequences from a failed attempt on an Obstacle or Crisis, refuses a Dilemma, or otherwise suffers harm, they may choose to suffer a Dramatic Loss, or to spend Plot Armor (PA) to protect themselves. A character has three PA tracks, Narrative, Scene, and Action level. 

The track that must be spent from depends on the Tier of the damage source and the Defense Tier of the character. If the Tiers are equivalent, the Action track is required. If the source is higher Tier, the track can be raised to the Scene track for 1 Tier, or the Narrative track for 2 Tiers. As normal, no more than half of the spent Tiers can be used to raise this effect. Characters are immune to damage from lower Tier sources.

Each track can prevent an amount of damage equal to the sum of the character's Persistence Ability ratings, minus any adjustment expended on raising the Defense Tier. This cannot exceed 10. If any track fills completely, it must be cleared, and any excess is applied after clearing. If a damage source would deal more damage in a single hit than the character's track can contain, any effects dependent on the affected Tier (such as Dilemmas or Loss) treat it as affecting the next higher Track.

Design notes:
The term Plot Armor is used in place of "hit points" or similar terms to make clear that damage does not necessarily represent injuries or wounds. Rather, spending Plot Armor on damage lets the player justify near misses, flukes of luck, emergency backup armor, or whatever other excuse the player can come up with for surviving attacks, resisting influence, ducking investigations, and so on.
