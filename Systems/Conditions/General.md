Conditions are status effects that give characters penalties or bonuses to certain rolls, restrict Actions, or threaten immediate consequences for taking or not taking certain Actions or Reactions. 

Most Conditions have multiple stages of increasing severity, which are cumulative, i.e. a character at Stage 3 still also suffers the effects of stages 1 and 2. These stages must be removed in descending order, so any triggers for removing stages 1 and 2 will not be considered until Stage 3 has been lifted.

If a character is under more than one effect that would give them the same Condition, they instead gain the next stage higher. Characters may opt to voluntarily take many Conditions, such as going Prone to make enemy ranged attacks harder.
