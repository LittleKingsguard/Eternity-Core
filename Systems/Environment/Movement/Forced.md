If a character is forced to move as a consequence of another effect such as a Shove, the player imposing that movement upon them may change their Engagement and Hazard tags as desired, or force them into a Hazard they are already Threatened by. 

The player may spend a Tier post-roll to instead force the target into a different Zone, or into an available Hazard they are not already Threatened by.
