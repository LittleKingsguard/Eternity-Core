Drift represents the way cinematic action tends to wander around the setpiece, with fights turning into back-and-forth chases depending on who has the advantage without interrupting the action to turn tail and run away. At the beginning of every round after the start of a Scene, immediately after Initiative is decided and in descending order of Initiative, Characters may choose to either Drift or Pursue.
