A Drifting character chooses an adjacent Zone to move to, and optionally may choose to spend AP or Effort on this motion. If they cannot cross into this Zone without passing an Obstacle, they must spend AP equal to its Difficulty, if any, and Effort equal to half its Resistance, if any. Likewise, they will be affected by any Hazard they Drift through without paying. If the Obstacle/Hazard has a higher Tier than the Sceneâ€™s Escalation, increase the AP/Effort cost by 4 for each Tier, or the cost of any Talent that provides a relevant Tier upgrade.
