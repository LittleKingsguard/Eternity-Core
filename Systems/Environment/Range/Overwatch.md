If a character has the means to take Overwatch Actions, then at the start of the Scene, in lieu of entering the Scene physically, they may choose to declare a direction “off-map” they are positioned in and can act from. They may only take Overwatch Actions normally, or Long-Range Actions if a Tier is spent to increase this. Likewise, they may only be targeted by such Actions. If used by a character in the Scene, an Overwatch Action is otherwise treated as Long Range.
