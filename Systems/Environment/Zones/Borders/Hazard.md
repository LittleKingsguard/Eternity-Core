Some effects, such as a height difference or long-fall gap between Zones, constitute a Hazard that must be passed through to cross into the next Zone. Assuming they survive, the character automatically succeeds at crossing into the target Zone, unless Opposed by a character in their starting Zone. Unless they spend a Tier to Multitask a second Action, however, they end their movement Threatened by the Hazard they just crossed. If a Hazard is also an Obstacle, a character that fails to cross still takes the Consequences, and is still Threatened by the Hazard.
