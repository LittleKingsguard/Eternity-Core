If a border between Zones has no defining Obstacle, Choke Point, or other features and simply subdivides a space too large to reasonably consider a single Zone, the border is Open. A character cannot fail an attempt to cross an Open border unless they are Opposed by a character in their original starting Zone. If a character in the desination Zone would successfully Oppose them, they still enter the Zone, but are Engaged by the reacting character immediately.
