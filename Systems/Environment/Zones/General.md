Zones are spaces on the map that track physical location relative to the Scene. Any number of normal-sized) characters may occupy a typical Zone, and characters may interact with any other characters, Hazards, or other features of interest within the Zone they occupy. This may (narratively) require moving within the Zone, but the distances are small enough that it will not require a separate Action to do so.
