A character becomes Engaged with another if:
 
 * they or the other character takes an Action that requires close contact, such as a melee weapon Attack, assisting with a Physical act, or relaying a secret through whispers. 
 * A character becomes Engaged as a consequence of movement if another character Opposes their Move Action and this results in them being in the same Zone. 
 * They choose to Engage another character as part of an otherwise unrelated Action, unless an Opposing character prevents them.
