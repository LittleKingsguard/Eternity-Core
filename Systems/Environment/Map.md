The map is the stage for a Scene, and locations within the map are tracked by Zones. This can be a detailed, physical map, or a simple network diagram showing how the zones are interconnected, and listing the traits and hazards of each Zone and border.

The size of the map depends on the level of Escalation of the Scene, or otherwise can scale with the Tier of any major Scene Goals. A map for Tier 0 play might be a single street, clearing, or a large building, with individual Zones being small rooms, alleys, or subdivisions of larger spaces.

A map for an Escalated Scene would have individual Zones being the size of an entire Tier 0 map, and represent an entire neighborhood, major compound or camp, etc. Escalating again would reduce that map to a single Zone, and so on.
