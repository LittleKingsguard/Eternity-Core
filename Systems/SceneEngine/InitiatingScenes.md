In the Narrative level, a player starting the Scene describes (within reason) the circumstances of the Scene, defines a Primary Ability and Escalation Level for the Scene overall, and then chooses the Supporting Ability that they specifically will use for the Scene.
Any other characters actively joining must use the same Primary Ability, if they have it, or the closest available equivalent if they do not. The Supporting Ability may be chosen freely. Passive characters instead use the Abilities associated with their Role granting the passive Join. When joining, the player chooses whether the character is an active participant or a passive supporter. 

Once all characters have either joined or declined, the GM/table then decides whether the Scene should be a Quick Scene or a Focus Scene.

The combination of these groups gives the player Agency and Impact with which to define their Goals for the Scene in the same way these groups define Dice and Power for Actions.

Goal Creation progresses in the order of the character starting the Scene, then in order of the starting player's choice. The target, if any, may insert themselves into the order any any point, if they actively Joined the Scene. If a character is only in the Scene because they are a target, they do not get Goals. Additionally, choose whether characters enter the Scene in Stealth. If a character has any Overt Assets they wish to bring into the Scene with them, they cannot be in Stealth unless they pay the Asset's Dice/Power in Agency. If the Asset has a higher Tier than the Scene's Escalation level, a Tier increase or equivalent cost must be applied.

Characters are not required to spend all available Agengy/Impact on Goals. Any unspent Agency/Impact grants [Reserves](https://github.com/LittleKingsguard/Eternity-Core/blob/177e81a06af1327f1d919343c784bfc3057677b8/Systems/SceneEngine/Reserves.md) during the Scene.

After all Goals are established, play shifts into the Scene itself.
