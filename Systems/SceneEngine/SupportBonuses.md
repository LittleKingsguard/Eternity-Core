During Goal Creation, players are not required to spend all of their alloted Agency and Impact on Goals. Any remaining are instead spent on Support Bonuses, gaining a number of uses equal to the unspent Agency and providing a total Bonus equal to the unspent Impact. Each use of this bonus represents some minor piece of equipment or consumable item that benefits the attempted action, a convenient setting element that makes their task easier or more impactful, a minor favor from a friend or friendly stranger, or some other small but useful quirk of happenstance the player describes when invoking the bonus.

These Support Bonuses can be invoked on any roll during the Scene, and the Bonus may be split between Dice and Power.
