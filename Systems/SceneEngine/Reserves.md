During Goal Creation, players are not required to spend all of their alloted Agency and Impact on Goals. Any remaining are instead spent on Reserve Bonuses, gaining a number of uses equal to the unspent Agency + 1 and providing a total Floating Bonus equal to the unspent Impact + 1. Each use of this bonus represents some minor piece of equipment or consumable item that benefits the attempted action, a convenient setting element that makes their task easier or more impactful, a minor favor from a friend or friendly stranger, or some other small but useful quirk of happenstance the player describes when invoking the bonus.
