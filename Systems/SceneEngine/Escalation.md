When initiating a Scene, the player may choose an Escalation Level. The Escalation Level increases the scale of the Scene, and higher levels of Escalation make it both easier and necessary to perform high-Tier Actions, as well as make it easier to learn the events of the Scene.

In an Escalated Scene, Goals may be upgraded for half the normal cost, and if they are being upgraded by the use of an Ability with Tier upgrades by default, the player may instead upgrade it twice for the cost of 2 Agency or 2 Impact. The total number of Tiers gained through these discounts cannot exceed the Escalation level. Similarly, Actions may be upgraded for the same discounted prices (4 Dice, 4 Power, or 2 Successes) or doubly-upgraded by the use of an Ability with Tier upgrades for the cost of 2 additional Dice or Power, or 1 Success. However, Goals cannot be established any lower in Tier than the Escalation Level, and Actions automatically fail if their final Tier is lower than the Escalation Level, including Miscellaneous Actions that normally do not require rolls.

Narratively, Escalated Scenes cover larger areas, longer timescales, larger crowds, etc., justifying their greater effect and difficulty.
