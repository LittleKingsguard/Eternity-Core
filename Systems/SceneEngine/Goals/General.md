A Scene Goal is something a player introduces into the Scene when their character starts or joins the Scene, and presents an opportunity to advance their plans or otherwise benefit them or harm an adversary. 

When creating the Goal, the player describes what they want to accomplish, such as attacking a rival or acquiring an Asset, and then *dictates* the existence of something in the Scene that their character can accomplish, and will fulfill that objective. Depending on the nature of the objective, their knowledge of the target, and the secrecy of the Scene, the character may or may not know the details or existence of the Goal, but it does exist. They're in the Scene for a reason, after all.

Design Notes:
There are several intents behind the Goal framework:
1. It provides a means to quantify the outcome of a scene for the purposes of Projects and other long-term plans that will take multiple Scenes to complete.
2. In a tactical game sense, it establishes victory points, win conditions for the scene, and fills out the roster of enemies or challenges.
3. It distributes some of the duties involved in creating a new setpiece on the spot from the GM to the players by giving them input on the sorts of enemies and hazards they encounter, making improvised battles and other scenes easier and faster to set up in a satisfactory manner and potentially enabling a table-centric (as opposed to GM-centric) playstyle.
4. By giving players input on encounter design, it attempts to ensure that all characers involved in the Scene have a specific niche in which they are useful.

In keeping with these principles, while a Goal should at least be a significant challenge (ex. an open-topped wall should not be set as an Obstacle Goal for a flying character), it is reasonable for a player to choose traits for their chosen Goals in such a way that their character is the best equipped to take on that challenge (ex. a player whose character favors armor-penetrating weapons choosing a Minion GOal and assigning it the "Heavily Armored" trait.) After all, they chose those weapons because the villain *clearly* splurges on armor for their lieutenants, right?
