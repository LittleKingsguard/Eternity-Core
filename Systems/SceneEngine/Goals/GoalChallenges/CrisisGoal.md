If introducing a Scene Goal as a Crisis, the Difficulty equals half of the amount of Agency invested in the Goal, and the Resistance is equal to the Impact invested. It is one Tier greater than the Goal itself, or the same Tier if it advances itself at a faster pace than once per Round. 

A Crisis Goal has Endurance 2 by default.

If the Crisis advances to completion, choose one of the following two options:
The Goal fails immediately, or
The Crisis replaces itself with an equivalent or similar Crisis one Tier greater than itself.

Design notes:
Crises as Goals exist to provide a time crunch on objectives beyond the normal limits of a Scene's duration. In addition to the "hard" time constraint that is the threat of the Crisis advancing to completion, a Crisis that has had time to advance itself takes more attempts to resolve than one that has not. 
This time pressure limits the amount of spare AP that can be spent on Prepare Actions or using Projects to upgrade Actions, which is why the Tier of a Crisis Goal is lower than that of an Obstacle Goal. Additionally, the mechanical structure of a Crisis forces it to take multiple Actions to resolve, which is why a Hazardous Crisis can have a lower Tier adjustment than a Minion Goal.
The default Endurance is present to prevent the Crisis from being resolved immediately before it has had a chance to advance at all. If the positioning of the Goal makes this especially easy to do so, this can be intensified by either increasing the Endurance, or simply starting the Scene *already* advanced by one or more degrees.
