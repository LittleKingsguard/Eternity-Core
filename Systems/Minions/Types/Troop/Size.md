A Troop has an additional property that individual Minions lack, Size. Size represents how many individuals form the Troop, and inversely how large the gap in capability is between each individual and the Troop as a whole. A Troop cannot have a Size greater than its Tier.

A Size 0 Troop is less than a dozen members, and each one is a significant component. If the Troop as a whole is better than 2/2, each individual functions as a 2/2 Minion of the same Tier. Otherwise, they are 1/1 Minions.

A Size 1 Troop consists of up to 100 individuals, and each individual is a 2/2 Minion one Tier below the Troop as a whole.

For each increase in Size above 1, raise the number of individuals represented by an order of magnitude. Each individual is a 2/2 Minion an equal number of Tiers below that of the Troop.
