If a Troop is smaller than twice the Scene’s level of Escalation, it acts as normal for characters with regard to Zones and movement.

If a Troop’s Size is the same as the level of Escalation, it completely fills the Zone it occupies, engaging all other characters it has and any relevant terrain features such as Choke Points and Hazards. Only one Troop may occupy the same Zone. Troops in adjacent Zones are Engaged with each other.

If the Troop’s Size is one level greater than twice the Scene’s Escalation, it instead completely fills a number of Zones equal to the lesser of its Dice or Power. If a single effect would hit multiple Zones it occupies, treat each additional Zone as another hit.

A Troop cannot be brought into a Scene if it is more than one Size larger than twice the Scene’s level of Escalation, but it may dispatch a sub-Troop to do so. It may continue dispatching Troops during the Scene as reinforcements, spawning them in an appropriate Exit Zone.
