Troops can subdivide, sending out individuals or small groups from their bulk to perform tasks such as Attacking isolated enemies, or guarding an area against infiltration. Doing this costs PA, which cannot be Recovered until the dispatched group returns. The dispatched group has the PA spent as its own PA track, and any remaining PA the group has is immediately added to main Troopâ€™s upon their return. A Troop can dispatch another Troop one Size smaller (or an individual for a Size 0 Troop) by paying SPA, or two Sizes smaller (an individual, for a Size 1 Troop) by paying APA. A larger Size difference than this does not account for enough members to have any mechanical significance.
