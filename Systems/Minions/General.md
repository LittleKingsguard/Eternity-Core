Minions are the characterâ€™s hirelings, connections, summons, drones, or other independent helpers. These usually come from Scenes or beginning-of-Scene rolls and Actions, but may be manifested in the middle of a Scene through the use of Assetss, or other such effects as Crises. Minions typically have four base attributes: Dice, Power, Tier, and a Specialty. They may also have a number of Bonuses. A Minion can represent either a single individual or a large number of less competent ones.

Unless otherwise noted, a Minion created by an Action disappears at the end of the Scene. However, Assets may include or be represented by Minions, and these Minions will persist on the next occasion that Asset is involved in a Scene. Losing such a Minion during a Scene may Progress a Project to destroy the Asset, destroy it completely (particularly in the case of Allies) or be considered an Attack by proxy against its creator.

Minions do not act in the Storyboard level, and are only present in Scenes if a character summons them during a Scene or brings them along while initiating or joining. Once present in the Scene, they act on their own turn, using their Dice/Power ratings as both Primary and Supporting Abilities for all purposes.
