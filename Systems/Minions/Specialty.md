A Minion has at least one Specialty by default. They are only at full effect when working in this Specialty. When working outside this Specialty, reduce their Tier by 1, or halve their Dice/Power ratings if they are already Tier I.

Design Notes:
Specialties are meant to be broad categories along the lines of professions, ex. soldier, engineer, reporter, etc.
