Stealth is a condition used to denote that a character doesn't have enough information about where (or potentially what) the other character is to meaningfully interfere with what they are doing. While a character is in Stealth, those they are hidden from cannot Oppose their rolls. Instead, the characters they are hidden from may attempt to detect them, intiating or advancing a Crisis with each Reaction. This Crisis may be advanced by Spillover, as usual. If the Crisis resolves, the Stealthy character is faced with a Dilemma of either revealing themselves or being hit with a Conflict Action of the Crisis's D/R/S+2.

A character can only lose Stealth either voluntarily or as a consequence of a Dilemma.
