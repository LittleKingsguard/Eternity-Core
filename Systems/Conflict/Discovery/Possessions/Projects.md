Like [Assets](https://github.com/LittleKingsguard/Eternity-Core/blob/43bf71b7fab623945f03e33bc05a222f7737a0ee/ResolutionEngine/Conflict/Discovery/Asset.md), Projects have multiple traits that need to be identified separately. A Project has a Location, Result, Difficulty/Resistance/Tier, Finesse, and Progress. For a Scene-Level Project, these are Obvious. For Storyboard-level Projects, characters gain Leads if they participate in a Scene that has Scene Goals relevant to the Project, or if they Discover Assets used in the Project.

Again, like Assets, a Project cannot be forced into a Scene as a target without knowing its location, and cannot have Scene Goals created against it without knowing the Result. 

A character may attempt to make Progress for or against a Project without knowing its D/R/Tier, but they will have to guess how difficult of a Goal or Project they must aim for to do so successfully. 

If they do not know the Finesse and Progress, they do not know if they have successfully stopped the Project permanently.
