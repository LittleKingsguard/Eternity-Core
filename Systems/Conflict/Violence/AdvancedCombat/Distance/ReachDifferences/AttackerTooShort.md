If the Attacker's weapon profile of choice only has Reach values shorter than the current distance, they must take in-Zone movement as part of the Attack. This may add a base D/R/Tier to the Attack due to difficult terrain or hazards, which the defender may use as an Assist as normal. If the defender has appropriate Reach, then they may treat the Attacker as Suppressed instad of both characters being Engaged.
