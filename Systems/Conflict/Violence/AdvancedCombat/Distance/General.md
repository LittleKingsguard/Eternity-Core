Two character that are Engaged in melee have a Distance between them, determining how effective weapons of a given Reach are. 

Distance can be Close Quarters, normal, or some value of Reach.  
An Attacker may choose the distance a fight takes place when declaring their Attack if any of the following conditions are true:
* They have any Stealth condition vs. the target
* The target has any Surprised condition vs. them

Otherwise, if either of the following conditions are true, the Attacker may choose any distance when declaring, up to the longest reach of any of the target's weapons:
* Neither character has the other Engaged
* The current Distance is greater than the longest reach among any weapons either character has Readied.

Thereafter, a character may change the distance after their Action by landing an Attack, forcing a Save, or forcing movement.
