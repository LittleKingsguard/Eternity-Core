Violence covers all Actions or Goals that directly harm another character or destroy their foundational possessions. This typically takes the form of an Attack Action, or a Conflict Goal that introduces some indirect means of attack, or, if the target has the Wealth, Organization, or similar Abilities, some means of destroying the Assets those represent.
