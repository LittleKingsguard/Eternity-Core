An Assassinate Goal is a direct attempt on a target's life safety, or freedom, and must be targeting a another Storyboard-level character. This may be either a direct attack or an indirect supporting Goal.

For a direct attack, rather than introducing a challenge as part of the declaring the Goal, this increases the cost of a Dramatic Escape. If the target makes a Dramatic Escape to exit the Scene and escape the attack, all such Goals complete and resolve as a single Attack against them which can only be defended against by any Goals they or their allies completed before attempting their Escape. This attack is upgraded twice as normal for Goals.

An indirect attack declares a way of cutting off support, methods of retreat, setting an ambush, or other means of assisting an attack on the target. Any such completed Goals are added to the above total if the target makes a Dramatic Escape, or Exits the Scene in a way that would be countered by the Goal in question.
