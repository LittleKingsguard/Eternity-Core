An Assault Goal introduces an Obstacle, Minion, or Troop that must be destroyed to undermine a target character with status-based Abilities such as Wealth or Organization. These Abilities represent deeper and more pervasive resources than can be represented by Assets alone, and the Assault Goal introduces a component of those resources into the Scene where they can be destroyed.

If the Goal is completed, during resolution it converts to an Attack against the target, with the normal two-Tier increase for Goals. The target's Defense Tier is upgraded against this Attack, due to the scale of their resources.
