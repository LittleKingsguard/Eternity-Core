Investigation seeks to find dirty secrets about the target character and expose them to the wrath of greater powers, sidestepping the dangerous or dirty work of directly confronting powerful enemies. This does, however, make it a difficult approach for targets that simply don't *have* skeletons in their closets, or are better at burying them than the investigator is at finding them.

If one character knows or suspects that another has committed an Offense, and has Evidence and has Discovered the true identity of their target, they may attempt to Investigate and press their case to the the offended Power.

The investigating character takes an Action or starts a Project that intends to reveal more about the targetâ€™s connection to the committed Offense, mechanically framing it as an Attack, which the target may Oppose by describing how they have been covering their tracks.

Investigation is generally indirect and covert. The target may be aware that *someone* might try following their trail and take steps to foil them, but unless the target or investigator takes direct Actions or Scenes to expose the investigator, they have no means of discovering anything about them.

Design Notes:
Unlike most "indirect" forms of conflict, this is *not* a Dilemma. Even if the target later atones for their Offenses or buries the evidence, they do not recover the lost Plot Armor. This is intended to represent the stress, distraction, and shortened patience on the part of the Power for any future such incidents.
