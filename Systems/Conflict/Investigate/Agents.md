If an Offense has been committed during a Scene, or if a character with known Offenses has had their identity Discovered during a Scene, characters may choose to call in Agents of the offended Power to enforce the consequences of said Offense.

This works as an Acquire Action/Project to gain a relevant Ally or Follower, except that the Tier required is reduced by 1, and the Agents, while likely sympathetic to the character that located their quarry for them, are not attached to the character.

If an Offense has been Overtly committed, or a character with active Offenses Overtly enters a non-secluded Scene without concealing their identity, this is instead a Crisis, advancing at the end of each Round. This Crisis has D/R/Tier equal to the Successes/Power of the Offending Action, and if it completes the Agents have the equivalent amount of Dice and Power (min. 2/2), and a Tier equal to this or the target's Defense Tier + 1, whichever is higher.
