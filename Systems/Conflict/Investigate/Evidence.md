Leads may be converted to Evidence as an Acquire Action. The Tier of the Evidence equals that of the roll. Evidence relating to the same Offense, or at least the same target offending the same Power, can always be used in the creation of another piece of Evidence.

Design Notes:
Allowing Evidence to always chain is because the character cannot benefit from using more than one Asset to assist an Action, thus the most recent Asset produced can be treated as encapsuling the notes for the full case.
