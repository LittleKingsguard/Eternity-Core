Most Actions and Projects produce Leads, scraps of evidence and telltale clues that can be used to figure out their secrets. Characters automatically gain Leads when perceiving any Actions/Reactions made outside of Stealth, including Actions on which the character loses Stealth. They may also gain Leads by investigating where an Action was taken as a Miscellaneous Action.

Further investigation of a Lead may convert it to Evidence, which can be used in further Investigate attempts.

A character may attempt to bury a Lead by taking an Obstruct Action or Project, hiding or removing evidence. If the Lead is Overt, the roll's difficulty is upgraded (or, equivalently, the Obstacle is downgraded).
If a non-Overt Action's effective Tier for [Spillover](https://github.com/LittleKingsguard/Eternity-Core/blob/13f4d3cafe1dc1d1c1dfa71870143d833680c80b/ResolutionEngine/DiceEngine/Tiers/Spillover.md) would be reduced below 0, it leaves no trace. It may still produce Leads from people witnessing it.
