A Contest is a means of handling Talent resolution that depends on overcoming a target in an Ability that may be unrelated to any Reaction they might make, such as a deceptive stike in Physical combat needing to overcome the target's Mental, even if their defensive reaction is a Physical dodge or Parry.

A Talent, Asset Trait, or other option that requires a Contest will specify the Ability the character uses, the Ability that is being targeted, and the currency that must be wagered (ex. Dice, Power, Successes, Effort, etc.).
* Physical Contests typically involve testing the target's reaction time, speed, might, or grace, such as an Attack that changes its direction mid-swing, intrigues they must rush to interfere with, or complex dances or ceremonies they must perform as part of a Social Action.
* Mental Contests test the target's knowledge, awareness, or intuition, such as feints and exotic/obscure strikes in Physical combat, Investigations that hinge on esoteric facts, or reading a bluff in Social engagement.
* Social Contests yest the target's skills at deception, communication, or empathy, such as deciphering an opponent's style in combat, testing an interrogator's patience, or turning an Influence action on itself.
* A Contest will only target an Expanded Ability as an additional option, or if it can only affect targets that have that Ability.

The player invoking the Contest has a base score equal to the Ability Rating specified by the source and the currency type used (i.e. a Physical contest using Dice will start at the declaring character's Physical Action rating).  

If the targeted character does not respond with a Reaction using the targeted Ability, their score starts as the lower of their targeted Ability's ratings.  
If they make a Reaction that does include the targeted Ability, it instead starts as the higher of the two.  
If the Reaction is using the targeted Ability as the Primary reaction, it instead starts as the sum of the two.

A Contest may also be invoked by a character making a Reaction, in which case the above is inverted, with the target's starting score set by the Abilities they declared for the Action.

Either or both characters may spend dice before rolling to increase their score. The highest final score wins, with the target winning ties.

Design Notes:  
A Contest usually provides the initiating character with a bonus or extra trick on victory, or penalizes the target. A particularly risky Contest might punish the initiating character for a loss.

A Contest initiated by the defending character is significantly stronger implicitly because the target has already chosen their Abilities, meaning a character with multiple Contest options can pick and choose the odd one out to target their weakness.
