A Contest is a means of handling Talent resolution that depends on overcoming a target in an Ability that may be unrelated to any Reaction they might make, such as a deceptive stike in Physical combat needing to overcome the target's Mental, even if their defensive reaction is a Physical dodge or Parry.

A Talent, Asset Trait, or other option that requires a Contest will specify the Ability the character uses, the Ability that is being targeted, and the currency that must be wagered (ex. Dice, Power, Successes, Effort, etc.).
* Physical Contests typically involve testing the target's reaction time, speed, might, or grace, such as an Attack that changes its direction mid-swing, intrigues they must rush to interfere with, or complex dances or ceremonies they must perform as part of a Social Action.
* Mental Contests test the target's knowledge, awareness, or intuition, such as feints and exotic/obscure strikes in Physical combat, Investigations that hinge on esoteric facts, or reading a bluff in Social engagement.
* Social Contests yest the target's skills at deception, communication, or empathy, such as deciphering an opponent's style in combat, testing an interrogator's patience, or turning an Influence action on itself.
* A Contest will only target an Expanded Ability as an additional option, or if it can only affect targets that have that Ability.

If a character is not using the relevant Ability for the attempt, either because they chose different Abilities or because they did not React, their Score starts as the lower of the two Ability ratings.  
If their attempt includes it as the secondary Ability, it instead uses the higher of the two ratings.  
If it instead using it as the Primary Ability, it instead uses the sum of both.

Either or both characters may spend dice before rolling to increase their score. The highest final score wins, with the target winning ties. Spending a Tier is the equivalent of spending 8 Dice/Power or 4 Successes/Effort. If a Contest would produce a Dilemma, the Power is equal to the margin of victory (max 10), and ignores Protection. A Contest can never deal damage directly without a Dilemma.

Design Notes:  
A Contest usually provides the initiating character with a bonus or extra trick on victory, or penalizes the target. A particularly risky Contest might punish the initiating character for a loss.

A Contest initiated by the defending character is significantly stronger implicitly because the target has already chosen their Abilities, meaning a character with multiple Contest options can pick and choose the odd one out to target their weakness.

The ban on a Contest dealing straight damage is because it is possible to force a win on a contest with less available counterplay than a regular roll.
