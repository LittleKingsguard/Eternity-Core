An Adversary ceases to be an Adversary if, as a result of Influence or other factors, they have no negative Intimacies for any Heroes, positive Intimacies for other Adversaries, or Intimacies of any context that clearly motivate them at cross purposes to the Heroes, or towards any Objectives the  Heroes require, and have no active Projects harmful to the Heroes. (note: many Adversaries may find “sunk cost” a valid reason to continue a project they have since lost their original motivation for, and need to be talked, forced, or thwarted into canceling it anyway.) Likewise, the inverse situation might break down a Hero and turn them away.

Such a “defeated” character might simply retire from the story, if they have no other Intimacies that would keep them in, or become a powerful Ally or even an additional Hero.
