Attempting to affect a character in ways other than direct violence still mechanically use damage. However, instead of simply dealing out Distraction or Stress or forcing them to spend Plot Armor, they present the target's player with a choice: take the damage, or comply with the acting character's terms. Narratively, this is the target being distracted/stressed by the pressure they are put under or, in more extreme cases, their player having to spend Plot Armor to invent a justification for why something that really should have worked, didn't.

For example, the following decisions could be enforced by Dilemma:
* Forcing them to take (or not take) a specific Action
* Changing their opinion
* Revealing important information
* Identifying themselves if unknown
* Losing contact/trailing
* Gaining Trailing
