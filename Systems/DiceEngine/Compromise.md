If an Action fails to succeed, lacks enough power to overcome Resistance and have any effect, or has insufficient Tier, the player may choose to succeed at a significant price instead of outright failing. The consequences should be agreed upon with the rest of the player group and be worked into the circumstances of the Scene. As a rule of thumb, spend the amount of Power required to guarantee the missing successes, and shortfall in Tier, then combine that cost with any shortfall in Power and double the total. Apply this result as Conditions or unmitigated damage to the character, representing extreme measures the character was forced to resort to, or bad luck on their part. 

For example, a character attempting to hide may have found the only viable “cover” was out of the window… of the third floor. Or, when jumping to clear a gap, come short and have to free a hand to catch themselves, dropping equipment and becoming Disarmed.
