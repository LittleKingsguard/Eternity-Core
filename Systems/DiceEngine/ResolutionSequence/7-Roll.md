After locking in the Dice/Power, the player then rolls the dice. Each die showing 4 or higher is a Success, and each 6 adds 1 Power to the attempt. The player may choose to convert 4 Successes into a Tier upgrade. If the total number of Successes is greater than 5, they *must* make this conversion until the total is reduced below 5.  
The resolution then depends on the nature of the Reaction, if any:

Any roll, unless Opposed by a Parry:  
If the roll does not generate enough Successes to overcome the Difficulty, the attempt fails, and skips to step 11. 

Opposed by a Parry:  
The shortfall in Successes is added to the Parry's Power, and resolution advances to the next step.

The player may then choose to convert any excess Successes over the Difficulty into Power.

The player may also choose to expend a Tier to cancel the Difficulty and pass automatically.
