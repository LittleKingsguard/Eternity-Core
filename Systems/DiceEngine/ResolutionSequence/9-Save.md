In the case of a severe trhreat to themselves or an Intimacy, the target or another character may choose to declare a Save, reducing the remaining Power of the attempt by their Protection.

If this reduced the remaining Power below 0, the attempt still succeeds for the purposes of any Talents or similar rules, but will not deal damage. The acting character may spend a Tier to eliminate the Protection instead.
