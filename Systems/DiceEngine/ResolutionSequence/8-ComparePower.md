After rolling and comparing Successes to Difficulty, the player may convert 8 Power into a Tier upgrade, and must do this if their Power is greater than 10. They may also choose to spend a Tier to reduce the Resistance to 0. They then subtract the Resistance of the attempt from their remaining Power. 

If this reduces the Power below 0, the roll fails and resolution skips to step 10. Many rolls such as Conflict Actions may technically succeed at 0 Power, but have no effect.
