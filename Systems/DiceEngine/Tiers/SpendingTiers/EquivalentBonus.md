Some effects, such as the Lethal trait on attacks, give the effects of a spent Tier directly. These do not count as Tier increases for the purposes of Spillover or the Success threshold for an Action, but they do count for purchasing effects. 

Example: 
A Lethal attack already has the “Raise Damage” bonus. To apply it a second time, the Action would have to be raised three Tiers, for a total of four “spent tiers”.
If an Action has multiple such bonuses, they each count towards this total, thus a Lethal Area Attack would only need two more Tiers before another could be spent on raising damage.
