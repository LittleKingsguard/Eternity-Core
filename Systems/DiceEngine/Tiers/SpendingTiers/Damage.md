If an attack would deal damage to one of a target’s PA tracks, instead deal damage to a higher track (APA → SPA → NPA). If it would already damage their highest track, they are defeated instantly.
Any Tiers spent on this option or effects that would give an equivalent bonus (ex. *Lethal*) may instead be counted towards the total for overcoming a target's Defense Tier. 

Example: 
A character with Defense Tier I takes no damage from a Tier 0 attack.
If the attack is Lethal, they take APA damage, because the bonus from Lethal counts as a Tier for the purpose of overcoming the Defense, instead of its normal effect of upgrading the damage level.
If the attack is also Tier I, then they take SPA damage because the attack's Tier overcomes their Defense, and Lethal can have its normal effect.
