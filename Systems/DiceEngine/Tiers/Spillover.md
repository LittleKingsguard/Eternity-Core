High-Tier Actions are massively powerful, and rarely clean of any side effects or collateral damage. To represent this, if a roll exceeds the Escalation of a Scene, apply a second, related Action with the same roll and downgraded to the Scene's Escalation to either the surrounding environment or nearby characters.

This is not necessarily harmful to the playerâ€™s intent, and it should fall to the acting Player to declare the form it takes. For example, it is perfectly reasonable to suggest that enemy Minions got caught in the middle of a barrage against a more powerful adversary. However, as with all things, narrative consequence should reign supreme, and Players deliberately choosing negative (or at least heavily complicating) side effects should be rewarded with Ascension Tokens.
