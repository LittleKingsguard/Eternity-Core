High-Tier Actions are massively powerful, and rarely clean of any side effects or collateral damage. To represent this, if a roll exceeds the Escalation of a Scene, apply a second, related Action with the same roll and downgraded to the Scene's Escalation to either the surrounding environment or nearby characters. This is usually destructive and unintended by the character, and to represent this by default it is the Nemesis for that character who determines the form this fallout takes, though they must remain consistent with the acting player's original narration for the action. If a character would be harmed by this additional effect, they may reduce the damage by their Protection and/or declare Saves as usual, ignoring resolution order.

By spending a Tier, the acting player may take control over the effects from their Nemesis, narrating beneficial side effects such as catching lesser enemies in the crossfire of their attacks.
