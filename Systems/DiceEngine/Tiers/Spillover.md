High-Tier Actions are massively powerful, and rarely clean of any side effects or collateral damage. To represent this, if a roll's Tier (including all spent Tiers!) exceeds the Escalation of a Scene, apply a second, related Action with the same roll and downgraded to the Escalation level of the Scene to either the surrounding environment or nearby characters. This is usually destructive and unintended by the character, and to represent this by default it is the Nemesis for that character who determines the form this fallout takes, though they must remain consistent with the acting player's original narration for the action. If a character would be harmed by this additional effect, they may reduce the damage by their Protection and/or declare Saves as usual, ignoring resolution order. If an Allied character would be harmed, their player may choose to veto the effect and demand a different one instead.

By spending one or more Tiers, the acting player may assert control over the effects, choosing one of the following options for each Tier spent:
* In place of the Nemesis's choice, the player and/or Nemesis may offer a neutral effect, such as creating an Obstacle. This compromise can be vetoed by the other party, resulting in no mechanical consequence.
* In addition to the Nemesis's choice, the player may also decare a similar Spillover effect that benefits their character, such as catching enemy Minions in the crossfire of an Attack.
