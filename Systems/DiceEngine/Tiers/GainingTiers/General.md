Increases in Tiers are referred to as "upgrades". Unless explicitly noted otherwise, each upgrade only increases Tier once. However, multiple uses from the same category stack. For example, 16 Power can be traded for two Tier upgrades.

If a Scene is Escalated, the character receives a half-cost discount on all Dice/Power/Successes spent. If a source would instead provide a direct upgrade in Tier, such as an invoked Major Talent or Ascension Token, the player may spend an additional 2 Dice or 2 Power to upgrade twice instead. Both effects can be done up to a total of the Escalation Level of the Scene.
