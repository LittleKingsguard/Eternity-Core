The Avoid rating for a Hazard is how difficult it is to escape, and a complicating factor for any characters Threatened by it. The Hazard Opposes any Action a Threatened character takes, and on a failure the character becomes Imperiled, or succumbs to the Hazard if they already are. If a Hazard does not have an Avoid rating, then it does not trigger any such effects, and characters only risk falling to the Hazard by their own Action or if forced in by another character.

Design notes: The Avoid difficulty is given to represent the difference between an entirely passive "safe" hazard that any reasonably aware character could be nearby without immediate risk, such as a flat roof or catwalk, and a more dangerous hazard that has a more nebulous risk, such as crumbling soil at the top of a cliff.
