Hazards are entities or effects present in the Scene (or, less frequently, the Narrative) that present a threat to characters even without them intentionally engaging it, but still lack any will or sentience to be characters themselves.

A character deliberately trying to cross or otherwise interact with a Hazard without harm must roll against its Difficulty/Resistance/Tier, taking any shortfall in Successes or Power additional Power on any associated Consequences.

An Obstacle or Crisis can also be a Hazard, in which case both rulesets apply. A deep pit or minefield, for example, would be a Hazardous Obstacle, and a spreading inferno would be a Hazardous Crisis.
