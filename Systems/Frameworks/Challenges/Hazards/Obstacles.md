If an Obstacle is also a Hazard, any character that fails to overcome the Obstacle also subjects themselves to the Hazard on a failure. They may use the same roll as their Reaction to resist the Hazard for free, or take a second Reaction as normal.

Depending on the method chosen, a character may also face the Hazard when failing to Bypass or Destroy the Obstacle as well.
