If a character suffers from a Hazard, they take Consequences, which typically involve damage or a Dilemma. As with an Attack, any difference between the character's Reaction and the Hazard's D/R is applied as bonus damage. 

If the Reaction beats the D/R but falls short in Tier, spend a Tier to remove the Successes, if the Successes are higher than the Difficulty, or otherwise negate the Power of the Reaction.

If it is still successful and still higher Tier than the Reaction, negate the Power.
