If a character Bypasses an Obstacle, they find or invent a way to circumnavigate it without any issues. Unlike with Overcoming the Obstacle, the character can simply reuse this method should they ever interact with the Obstacle again, succeeding automatically. Depending on the means of the bypass, they may or may not be able to take other characters with them, or allow others to use it.

If an Obstacle does not have an explicit Bypass rating, it is the same as the Overcome rating, but upgraded one Tier.

Design notes: 
Examples of bypasses include acquiring the keys to a lock, leaving climbing ropes along a cliff, or memorizing the answers to a puzzle.
