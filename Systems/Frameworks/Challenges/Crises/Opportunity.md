When a Crisis is initiated by a character's failure, spillover, or another character inflicting one upon them, another hostile character may take the opportunity to add additional consequences for letting the Crisis resolve, such as tracking down and confronting the target in a Scene, revealing critical information, or something else that would be appropriate for a Dilemma threatening Stress (for in-Scene Crises) or Plot Armor (for Narrative-level Crises).

This can be done through the following methods:
* 1 Stress may be paid immediately
* A Stinger may be taken at the end of the Scene to sieze the opportunity for all relevant Crises created during the Scene
* A Scene may be spent to claim any or all active Narrative-level Crises
