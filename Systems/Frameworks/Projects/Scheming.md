If another character has full knowledge of a Project that has advanced, they may, as a Reaction (for Scene-level Projects) or as a Stinger (for Storyboard-level Projects), make a Progress attempt towards one of their own Projects to which the events of the original Action or Scene are relevant, using the original roll as a Supporting bonus.

One Progress attempt may trigger multiple such Reactions, but if the number of Schemes made off of a Project exceeds that Project's Redundancy, the project suffers a setback, reducing the Redundancy as normal.

If a Project is advanced by the Scheme, that Project may itself be Schemed off from by additional Reactions. However, a Project cannot benefit from any such "chain" of Schemes more than once.
