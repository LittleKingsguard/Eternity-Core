An Appearance Asset is some combination of outfit, presentation, and bearing that intends to give onlookers a certain impression of the character, typically for Social purposes. A character might, for example, have a set of fine clothing and jewelry to help pass for a higher class than they really are, or an experienced captain might find they get more business if they play along with stereotypes.

Destroying or Disarming an Appearance might be as simple as trashing or stealing the clothes or accessories involved, but others may not be so simple and require changing people’s opinions of them, such as changing fashion trends so it is no longer attractive, convincing society that it’s all an act, or at least that they’re trying too hard to the point where they deserve mockery instead of respect.
