When entering a Scene, the player may choose to bring any of their Allies with the character, or even in place of the original character. This adds the Ally as a Minion under the player’s control in addition to, or instead of, the character starting the Scene. An Ally cannot be used for this if they are already part of an ongoing Scene, limiting their use in Cutaways or Transitions.

If the Ally takes any SPA damage while present as a Minion, any Projects to eliminate them as an Asset advance at the end of the Scene. If they are defeated during the Scene, they are lost as an Asset. Depending on the tone and events of the story, this may not necessarily mean death; they could simply decide their debts are paid, the job is more than they signed on for, or they’re no longer qualified to help.
