Assets are generally easier to destroy than create, though it is also generally easier to protect an Asset with Reactions than it is to interfere with attempts to create them. Destroying an Asset is a Project or Action two Tiers above the Assetâ€™s rating and with D/R equal to its effective bonus. Stealing an Asset is more complicated, and is usually one Tier more difficult than simply destroying it.
