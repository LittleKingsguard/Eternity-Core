A Vehicle has traits similar to both Allies and Gear when in use during a Scene. Like Allies, they function as a Minion, having Dice, Power, a Specialty, their own AP and Initiative, and taking their own Actions. However, a Vehicle only takes an Action when it is Assisted by at least one character or it has the most remaining AP, in which case it will default to either doing nothing or repeating its last Action (ex. moving in a straight line), as appropriate. When Assisting the Action, the Assisting character can use the Vehicle istelf as a Bonus, but only gains the Tier and does not add Dice/Power.

When a Vehicle is used for its designed task, such as high-speed travel, transporting heavy loads, earthmoving, or combat, the Action is upgraded in Tier after all other post-roll modifiers are applied.

Design Notes: 
Vehicles take their own Actions to represent that they are not entirely under the control of their owners and more beholden to their physical limits, ex. If a truck's suspension cannot take the weight of a heavy cargo load, the owner/user having prodigious strength themselves is not going to be of much help.

The driver gains the Tier bonus from the Vehicle to make sure that driver skill will consistently actually matter, even for very large/fast/capable/expensive vehicles that an otherwise mundane character might find themselves controlling.
