Finally, if the character or any allies have committed Offenses against the power represented by the Connection, they may erase the Offense by applying the Asset. If the Offense is of an equal Tier to the Asset, this expends the Asset. If the Offense is of a higher Tier, the character may expend the Asset to gain its Bonus towards any Project intended to erase the Offense. Otherwise, the Asset is lost.
