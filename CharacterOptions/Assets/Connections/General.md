Connections represent the characterâ€™s standing with organizations or individuals either too loose and nebulous to directly participate in the story, or so powerful that their presence more looms over the Narrative than engages it.

If the character commits an Offense against the entity represented by the Connection, the Asset is lost unless it is used to seek Forgiveness.
