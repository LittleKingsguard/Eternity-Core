Assets are transient things the character either possesses or currently has working in their favor, but may be spent as they are used, or can be broken or destroyed by hostile action. When taking an Action or introducing a Scene Goal for which the Asset is relevant, the player may add the Asset's ratings to the roll as a Bonus. [As normal for Bonuses](https://github.com/LittleKingsguard/Eternity-Core/blob/7a5aedf0dd1e48fed9ad6cfd4cc127645f18c0ba/DesignPrinciples/RuleAssumptions/BonusStacking.md), the Dice/Power/Tier can only be affected by one Asset per roll.
