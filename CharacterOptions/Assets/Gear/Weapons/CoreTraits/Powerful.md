Powerful weapons are brute-force implements designed to hammer through an opponent's guard and concuss straight through armor. When used for an Attack, the Resistance provided by Parry, Evade, or Oppose Reactions is negated as if spending a Tier. Against Parries, the bonus may instead be used to stack with the base Tier for the purposes of overcoming the Parry's Tier, but this expends the effect.

When used to Parry, if the Attack fails to mee the Difficulty imposed by the Parry attempt, the Parry is upgraded. The attack immediately fails without comparing Power if this raises the Parry above the Attack's Tier. If the Attack is benefitting from any effect such as the above that would negate Resistance, that may instead be expended to cancel this upgrade.
