A Swift weapon is supremely nimble, and aims to allow the user to overwhelm their target with rapid flurries from multiple angles and directions. However, they are also very light weapons that suffer for sheer hitting power, and cannot end a fight with a single solid blow the way a Lethal weapon can. 

When Attacking, the Difficulty of the Attack is canceled as if spending a Tier. This bonus stacks with the base Tier of the Attack for the purposes of overcoming the Tier of any Reaction, but the bonus is expended doing so.

When Parrying, the Parry instead gets gets Successes equal to 5 or the total number of dice available, whichever is less.  
(Ex. A character with 4 Physical Dice using a weapon with a 2-Dice bonus would normally convert half their Dice to Successes when calculating the Reaction. If the weapon is a Swift staff, they would instead convert 5 Dice all to Successes, and could convert the sixth die straight to Power without reducing the Difficulty added by their Parry.)
