Weapons are Gear items specifically meant for combat actions such as Attacks, Parries, and Physical Control attempts. When using the advanced combat rules (and thus implicitly expecting combat to be a significant part of the game) weapons are expanded in detail in comparison to more generic gear.

When not using the advanced combat rules, weapons act as normal Gear, but gain the Lethal trait for free.

When using the advanced combat rules, the weapon instead has a designed number of hands, one or more use profiles and associated Core Traits, and may choose traits from an expanded list.
