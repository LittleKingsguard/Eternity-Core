A versatile weapon can be used one-handed, but gains additional utility or power when used in two or more. The size of a versatile weapon means it is Obvious even when sheathed, and it cannot be Concealable.

When used in one hand, it has no other special features. If used in two hands, it either gains a second possible use profile, or gains a +1 Floating Bonus to all rolls.
