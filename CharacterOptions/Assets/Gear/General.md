Gear is a characterâ€™s personal equipment, with higher ratings in Gear representing more and better materiel. It is, by definition, almost always man-portable and has to be physically in the Scene in order to be used, making it the most vulnerable to being attacked and/or disarmed and stolen, but also has the greatest variety of possible uses, even if any single piece of Gear may tend to be single-purpose.
