Armor is a type of Gear that grants passive Parry reactions against violence against the character, or similar Hazards. As normal for passive Reactions, the player cannot spend Effort or other currencies on the Reaction.

Because armor is worn instead of carried or held, the player must choose whether or not to have it equipped at the start of the Scene, and cannot equip or remove it during the Scene.

A character can have more than one set of armor equipped, but can only choose one to gain the benefits from on any given Reaction.
