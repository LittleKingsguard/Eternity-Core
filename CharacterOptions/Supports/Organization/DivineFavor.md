Unlock: Divine Soul only.

*A channel of power exists between the Divine and their faithful. Which this usually carries away the Anima used to fuel the Divine Spark, the Divine may let the resultant Aether flow back into their Champion in a manifestation of their will and might.*

Trigger: A follower, Ally, or other faithful character makes any roll

Effect: The Action gains a Floating Bonus equal to the Power Rating of the Divine's Organization Ability or their Power Rating for the roll's Primary Ability, whichever is higher. If the character currently has damage on an Influence or Control dilemma meant to challenge their faith, the damage is reduced by the same amount.

Going Hot: The floating bonus is equal to the sum of both above ratings, but the Divine's influence is Obvious, or Overt if the Action was already Overt or Obvious.
