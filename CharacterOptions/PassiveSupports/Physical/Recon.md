Unlock: Any Physical Role

*A plan without information is just guesswork. A plan with secondhand information is a trust exercise.*

Trigger: A friendly character is making a roll that interacts with a Hazard, Goal, terrain element, or Asset associated with the Location (including guards thereof)

Benefit: The supporting player introduces a new detail to the Scene that the benefitting character can use to gain a Floating Bonus equal to the Support's Power. This detail is persistent in the Scene, and other characters can use it for the same purpose. Additionally, if the character would normally treat something relevant to the roll as Unknown or Undetected, it is instead Hidden.

Going Hot: 

Close Infiltration, per use -- The supporting character took risks entering the Location on their recon, and traces were left behind. The benefitting action provides a Lead against the character, and Investigating the Lead as a Miscellaneous Action advances or initiates one Investigation Project against them.
