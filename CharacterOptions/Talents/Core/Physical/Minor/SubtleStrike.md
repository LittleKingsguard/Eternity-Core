# Subtle Strike

Use: When declaring an Attack  
Cost: +1 Successes  
Benefit:  
If the cost spent on this Talent is greater than the target’s Mental Action rating, they do not realize the attack’s success and effects, if possible, until an appropriate time in the scene. The Attack is not inherently Overt, though any Overt/Overt-Use Gear, Talents, or other effects may still make it so. If the attacker was at least Unlocated, they remain so and the target mistakes any contact or pain for something unrelated. Otherwise, the target simply thinks the attack missed.
