# Overpenetrate

*The avalanche does not stop at the first tree it fells, only the valley floor gives it rest. So too should the hammer not stop at the first splintered shield, but continue to its natural rest.*  
--Codex of the Everlasting Mountain, Book III: Attack

Use: After a successful Attack  
Cost: 1AP  
Benefit:
If an attack defeats a target or would fill one their PA tracks, the remaining Power may instead be redirected towards another target within reach or line-of-fire. This new Attack has the same successes as the original Attack, and the new target may declare their own Reactions as normal.
