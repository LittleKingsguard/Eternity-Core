# Quick Draw

*Adage #61: Do not throw the first punch in a swordfight.*  
--88 Adages for the Adventurous Aetherborn

Use: When declaring an Attack, Parry, or other roll that could benefit from a weapon  
Cost: none  
Benefit:  
The character may use a weapon they do not have readied at the start of the attempt, readying it during the process. If a weapon trait or other effect would already give them this bonus, the draw instead happens fast enough that other characters are caught Off-Guard.
