# Riposte

*Consider: The sword your enemy holds at your throat is not defending his own.*  
--Sword Soul Pratikriẏān

Use: When declaring a Parry  
Cost: 1+ Successes, 1+ Power  
Benefit:
If the Parry attempt succeeds, as part of this same Reaction an Attack may be made against the original attacker. This attack automatically gets Successes and Power equal to the cost paid instead of rolling, and the opponent cannot Parry or Oppose with the same weapon as their original attack. They may choose to cancel their Attack when this Talent is invoked, preventing the counterattack as well.
