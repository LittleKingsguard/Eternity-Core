# Mastery of the Phantom's Passage

*Noise and shine are simply energies lost to the unpleasantries of the Physical Realm. Perfection in art, craft, and being would waste nothing, and so would be silent and dun. In the pursuit of perfection, then, one must ask: is the world we see absent of perfect things because they cannot exist; or are we lost in a world of perfection, only perceiving what is as imperfect as ourselves?*  
-- Cycle of the Eternal Horizon, CCCXXVI

Benefit:  
When the character is in stealth, Discover attempts to reveal their presence and/or location treat the character's DT as one higher. 

If another character has Contact or Tracking on them and invokes this in Scene initiation to target them or an Asset they possess, this character may force them to pay Agency and Impact equal to their Physical ratings or they successfully break Contact or lose Tracking before the start of the Scene. They cannot be forced into the Scene, and the Scene does not take place in the location it normally would have. The character can still Join normally, and they are Undetected if they do.

When the consequences for Going Hot would result in a Lead being created, instead of the Discovery/Investigate attempts being a Miscellaneous Action, it is instead an Obstacle of standard D/R and Tier equal to the character's DT + 1.
