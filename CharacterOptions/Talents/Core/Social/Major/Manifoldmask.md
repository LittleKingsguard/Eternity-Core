# Mastery of the Manifold Mask

Use: Being in or entering Stealth via disguise, wearing an Alias, attempting to establish one, or similar Actions.  
Benefit:  
Actions taken to pass off as a different character are upgraded in Tier. If being Investigated to discover the characterâ€™s identity or other information hidden by the disguise, the minimum Tier is upgraded by 1.

When the consequences for Going Hot would result in a Lead being created, instead of the Discovery/Investigate attempts being a Miscellaneous Action, it is instead an Obstacle of standard D/R and Tier equal to the character's DT + 1.
