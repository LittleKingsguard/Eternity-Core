# Mastery of the Whistling Birds

*The rumor that starts somewhere is curious. The rumor that starts everywhere is dangerous.*  
-- Whispering Soul Tavaneye

Use: Attempting to covertly take a Social Action.  
Benefit:  
By understanding the flow of gossip through a Social Scene, the character can feed truths and lies into the rumor mill far enough upstream that their fingerprints upon them will all but wash away by the time they reach their targets. If the affected Social action would normally be Overt, it isnâ€™t, and the minimum Tier for Investigate attempts to discover the character using their action as a clue is upgraded by 1.

Additionally, the on the first time during a Scene the character Goes Hot on a Social Support, they do not take consequences.
