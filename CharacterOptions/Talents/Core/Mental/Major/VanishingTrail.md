# Mastery of the Vanishing Trail

*Knowing the shape of oneâ€™s footprint is the first step towards erasing it.*  
-- Manual of Absence, Chapter I: Preliminary Studies

Benefit:  
 When targeted by investigate Actions aimed at uncovering secrets or proving Offenses (*not* breaking Stealth), the minimum Tier required for damage is increased by 1.

Additionally, upgrade the Tier of attempts to Oppose such investigations against an allied character, or destroy/conceal Overt evidence.

When the consequences for Going Hot would result in a Lead being created, instead of the Discovery/Investigate attempts being a Miscellaneous Action, it is instead an Obstacle of standard D/R and Tier equal to the character's DT + 1.
