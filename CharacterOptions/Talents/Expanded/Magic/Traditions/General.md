All attempts using a Magic Ability must use at least one Tradition for each such Ability used. Most Traditions are specific to a single Ability.

The Tradition chosen defines the character's approach to magic and how they are channeling it, dictates how they gain and spend Passion, and usually grants bonuses depending on what they are trying to accomplish and their current state.
