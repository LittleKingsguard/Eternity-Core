Passion is a resource used by all Primalist Abilities that tracks how attuned the character is to the Shapes they have connected to and how much influence the ideals of the Shape have over the character's current behavior. Most Primalist Traditions of Magic grant Passion gain, and have additional effects based on the current state of their Passion. **Additionally, by investing Passion into a Primalist roll, they may gain a Floating Bonus equal to half the invested Passion, but they only regain their investment if their roll succeeds.** 

## Restrictions
* **A character cannot invoke Primalist Talents as part of a roll unless they are either gaining or spending Passion. Investment is never sufficient alone.**
* **If a character switches Traditions, all Passion that is not invested in permanent or sustained effects is lost. The character must be using a Tradition associated with the Talents invoked.**
* **If a Talent would have a passive effect, it only applies if the character's most recently invoked Tradition is associated with that aspect, and they have uninvested Passion available.**

## Costs
* If a character gains Passion and this would cause them to exceed their starting value, they must spend 1 Effort to keep the increase.
* If a character gains Passion and this would cause them to exceed their soft cap, they must instead spend 1 Action Point to keep the increase.
* If a character would gain Passion but has already reached their hard cap, they cannot increase it but may spend 1 SPA to treat it as an increase for the purposes of allowing them to use Talents.
* If a character starts a round with enough invested Passion to put them over their starting/soft cap, they must immediately spend Effort/AP for each point, as above.
