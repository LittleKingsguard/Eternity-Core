# Ashen Renewal

*The Flame is rebirth, for just as the Flame spreads and consumes what is old and static, the new and vibrant feed on the ashes.*  
-- Path of Dancing Light, Book IV

## Incarnate Form
Use: Reaction to Attack against self or ally  
Range: Flame Shaping  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 2 (Declare), Step 9 (Resolve) 
Benefit:  
In place of a normal Oppose or Parry, the target instead reduces the Attack's Power by an amount equal to the character's current Passion or their lowest Primalist rating, whichever is lower. If the target accepts this aid, no combination of effects may reduce the total damage taken below 1 APA.

## Idealized Concept
Benefit:  
The character gains the following Support Option, which may be used even if they are active in the Scene:

Trigger: A character takes damage from any Conflict Action other than Disover or Investigate  
Timing: Step 9  
Benefit: The Power of the Attack or Hazard is reduced by the Power of the Support. If the target accepts, the total damage taken cannot be reduced below 1 APA.  
Going Hot:  
Emergency Care, per use -- Both the Supported and Supporting character have their Agency or Impact in the next Scene reduced by 1. If either character is Tracked or has Contact by a third party, they both are.
