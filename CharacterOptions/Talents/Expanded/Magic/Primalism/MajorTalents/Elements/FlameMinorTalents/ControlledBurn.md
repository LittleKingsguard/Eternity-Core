*#57: Do not light off big fireballs in small rooms.*  
-- 88 Adages for the Adventurous Aetherborn

## Incarnate Form
Use: Any Flame Shaping Action  
Cost: 1 Die/Success  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
One character per die spent is not affected by the normal splash/area damage of a Flame Shaping Action. Troops or large terrain objects such as Obstacles or Hazards can be excluded for 1 Success each.

## Idealized Concept
Use: When targeted by any effect leveraging one of the character's Intimacies  
Cost: 1+ APA or SPA  
Timing: Step 8/9  
Benefit:  
The character wields the Primal Flame against their own temptations, temporarily burning away emotional connections that would lead them astray. The character may spend 1 APA each to ignore a Minor Intimacy for the rest of the Scene, or 1 SPA to ignore a Major Intimacy.
