# Sustained Heat

*The Flame is Persistence, for it continues its dance until the final end.*  
-- Path of Dancing Light, Book I

## Incarnate Form
Use: Any Flame Shaping Attack  
Cost: 1+ Effort/APA  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
The targets of the Attack remain Suppressed by a constant wash of flames even after the initial blast. This continues until the character uses this Talent again or has made Reactions using the Suppression equal to the cost paid.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Reaction, during a Flurry, max Passion  
Cost: Passion  
Timing: Step 2  
If a Flurry would be ended early by the character making a Reaction, the character may instead expend their Passion to continue the Flurry.
