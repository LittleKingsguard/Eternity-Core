# Cataclysm Seed

*Even the fires of the greatest suns begin with a single spark.*  
-- Codex of the Burning Soul, Book V

The character condenses power into a single point that trembles with destructive potential and slowly builds in intensity and influence before erupting into sudden, massive violence.

Suitable Aspects:
* Earth -- Sinkhole forms if Hazardous Terrain is created, any damaged characters fall in.
* Fire -- Ground is scorched red hot or even melted to glass.
TODO: #79 Add more Aspects later

## Incarnate Form
Use: Special Move  
Range: As normal for Attack  
Cost: 4+ Invested Passion  
Timing: Step 1  
Benefit:  
The character may create an Cataclysm Seed as an Obstruct Action. This is a Hazard that the player may choose to detonate as a Round Delay Attack targeting the next largest Area or the entire Zone, whichever is bigger. A character threatened by the Hazard when the blast goes off has any Difficulty vs. targeting them negated as if spending a Tier.  
If the explosion's tier is greater than the Scene's level of Escalation, the Zone becomes Hazardous terrain. (See above for suggestions.)
