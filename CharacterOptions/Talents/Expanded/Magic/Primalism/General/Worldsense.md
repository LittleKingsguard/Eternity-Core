* Flame: Only targets within fire or smoke
* Wind: Only moving targets in air
* Wave: Only targets under/in water

## Incarnate Form
Use: Discover/Investigate attempts  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
The character may use their Shaping abilities as part of an attempt to perceive their surroundings, subject to the above restrictions but ignoring cover and concealment and gaining the usual bonuses for invested Passion and invoked Major Talents. By GM/table decision, indirect contact (ex. Stonesense looking for someone standing on an elevated floor) may count as concealment for the purposes of hiding and discovery.
