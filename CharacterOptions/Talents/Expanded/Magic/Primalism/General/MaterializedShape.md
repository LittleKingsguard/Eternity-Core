# Materialized Shape

*A Tempest brings water where it will.*  
-- Cycle of Sea and Sky, Book III

A drawback of Primalist disciplines is they are often reliant on their chosen aspect being physically present in the scene before they may control it. This advanced technique provides a means of conjuring enough from the Shadow Sea to allow them at least a modicum of utility, even in the most deprived states.

## Incarnate Form
Use: Acquire Action  
Cost: 1 Effort/Tier  
Timing: Step 1  
Benefit:  
The character manifests their element from the Shadow Sea, or forms some iconic scenery from their attuned environment, such as jungle vines or desert sands. They may use this for future Shaping attempts in the Scene as if an Asset that provides no Bonus. Without a means of carrying it with them without continuous Shaping Actions, they lose it at the end of the Scene.
