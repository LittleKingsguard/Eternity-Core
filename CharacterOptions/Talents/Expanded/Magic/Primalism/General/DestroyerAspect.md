# Destroyer Aspect

*A physical fire can be smothered by sand. This is a failing of the Physical to reflect the ideal form. The true flame is consumption itself. It does not care for the laws of Alchemy, for it will consume those too.*  
-- Codex of the Burning Soul, Book III


Suitable Aspects:  
* Flame
* Hunter
* Desert

## Incarnate Form
Use: Any Primalist Action that deals damage or destroys an Obstacle/Hazard  
Cost: 1 Effort  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
If the Attack did not have the Lethal Core Trait, it gains it as an option. If it already had Lethal, it gains Piercing. If the attempt succeeds at destroying an Obstacle, Asset, or other item, or defeating a character, the target is reduced to nothing.

## Idealized Concept
Use: When eating, or against swallowed target  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1/2  
If the character has a body of flesh or otherwise requires sustenance, they may digest anything and gain suitable nutrition.  
If the character swallows something with meaningful durability, such as an Asset or another character, they may take a Destroy or Attack Action against it, and does so for free at the start of the Round. This action is Lethal, and has the Difficulty negated as if spending a Tier. At the end of the Scene, they make one final attempt, upgrading twice. If the target survives this, the character must spit them out.

Anything destroyed in this manner leaves no evidence of its destruction.
