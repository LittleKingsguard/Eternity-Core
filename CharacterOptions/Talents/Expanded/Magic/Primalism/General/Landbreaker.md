-- Law of Earthly Foundations, Book III

The practitioner deliberately exacerbates the normal collateral damage and spillover of their actions, wrecking the ground and covering it with remains of their work, be it jagged rubble, choking vines, or fine sand.

## Incarnate Form
Use: Any Shaping Action  
Cost: 1+ Dice, 1+ Power  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
The character manipulates the ground they drew the material of their attack from, leaving pits of jagged spikes, unstable rubble, or even pulverizing it to a mire of fine sand. This multitasks an Obstruct Action as part of their original roll, adding a new Obstacle or Hazard to the target's Zone or turning it into Difficult Terrain. The D/R of the feature is equal to half the Dice/Power expended.
