The manifestations of a Primalist Action are most strongly shaped by the Tradition(s) the mage is invoking for their casting. As this usually overlaps with the Shape and thus the "real" effects of the spell, this can cause self-taught or less studious mages to not realize they *have* any manifestations, or that magic in general has them at all. However, it becomes vividly apparent if a mage expands outside of their element and attempts to work in their newly-acquired skills using old techniques, or vice versa, as a Flame/Wind Shaper findes it impossible to direct the breeze without it filling with smoke or heat shimmer.
