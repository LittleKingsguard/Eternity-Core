# Wave Shaping

*To ask what water and the Wave is is both meaningless and profoundly meaningful.*  
*It is the pounding surf that wears the mountain down to sand.*  
*It is the stream in the ditch that waters the field.*
*It is the cloud on the breeze.*
*It is motion and necessity, and its Shape is that which it must be.*  
-- Scrolls of Fluid Living, Book I

Before choosing from the below options, the character gains access to one of the following Font of Magic options:
* Crashing Wave
* Reflective Pool

## Incarnate Form
Cost: -- or 1 E/APA  
Timing: Step 1/2  
The character's attunement to the Prinal Shape of the Wave allows them to manipulate the water around them. When using this ability as part of an attempt such as Attack, Obstruct, Initiate/Progress Actions, etc., the character gains a Floating Bonus equal to their current Passion and may Upgrade that attempt by paying 1 Effort or APA.

As an Attack, water attacks use the following weapon profile:  
Core Trait: Control  
Short Range
Targets: Target + Splash or All Engaged
Traits: Forceful

## Idealized Concept
Cost: -- or 1 E/APA  
Timing: Step 1  
As the Wave rolls off the impenetrable face and instead washes through the thinnest of cracks, so too does the character work through the flaws of their enemies. As a passive effect, they ignore penalties to their roll (ex. Blitz) equal to the lowest of the Primalism ratings. When taking Actions they may name a Core Ability. Unless another character Opposes or Parries them using that Ability for the reaction, the attempt is Upgraded. If another character Opposes or Parries and does not use the chosen Ability, the cost of this Talent is refunded.
