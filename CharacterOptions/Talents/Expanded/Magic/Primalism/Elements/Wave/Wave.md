# Wave Shaping

*To ask what water and the Wave is is both meaningless and profoundly meaningful.*  
*It is the pounding surf that wears the mountain down to sand.*  
*It is the stream in the ditch that waters the field.*
*It is the cloud on the breeze.*
*It is motion and necessity, and its Shape is that which it must be.*  
-- Scrolls of the Fluid Life, Book I

Before choosing from the below options, the character gains access to one of the following Tradition options:
* Crashing Wave
* Reflective Pool

## Incarnate Form
Cost: -- or 1 E/APA  
Timing: Step 1/2  
The character's attunement to the Primal Shape of the Wave allows them to manipulate the water around them. When using this ability as part of an attempt such as Attack, Obstruct, Initiate/Progress Actions, etc., the player may Upgrade that attempt by paying 1 Effort or APA.

As an Attack, water attacks use the following weapon profile:  
Core Trait: Control  
Short Range
Targets: Target + Splash or All Engaged
Traits: Flexible

## Idealized Concept
Use: Contest X vs. X  
Cost: 1 E/APA  
Timing: Step 1/2  
As the Wave rolls off the impenetrable face and instead washes through the thinnest of cracks, so too does the character work through the flaws of their enemies. As a passive effect, they ignore penalties to their roll (ex. Blitz) equal to the lowest of the Primalism ratings. When making any attempt they may declare a Contest using and targeting any Ability they possess. If the character is using the chosen Ability, they may also invest Passion into the roll, gaining the normal +1 floating bonus per 2 points. If the character wins the Contest, the attempt is Upgraded.
