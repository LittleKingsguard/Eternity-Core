*All that enters the Sea finds its end on the beach, or the bottom.*  
-- Cycle of Sea and Sky, Book IV

## Incarnate Form
Use: Any Action or Assist  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 7  
Benefit:  
Water rises to surround the target, attempting to force itself into airways or crush down with the pressure of the ocean floor. If the target of an Action is Prone, Restrained, or in deep water (Ex. Hazard), the character may instead choose to treat the Wave Shaping attack profile as Lethal. 

## Idealized Concept
Use: After a target accepts a Dilemma vs. Forced Movement or a Balance or Restraint Condition  
Cost: 1 SP  
Timing: Step 12  
The character invokes the force of an undertow, unleashing a follow-up strike that redoubles their control. The target receives a second Dilemma of the same damage and applying a different effect from the above list.
