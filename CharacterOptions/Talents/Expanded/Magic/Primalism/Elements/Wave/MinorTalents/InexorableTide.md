# Inexorable Tide

*Time and tide both wait for no man, for they are fundamentally the same.*  
-- Cycle of Sea and Sky, Book VI

## Incarnate Form
Use: Wave Shaping Obstruct Action  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1  
Benefit:  
The character calls forth currents of water in the target Zone, transforming it into Hazardous Terrain. The Hazard threatens a Dilemma vs. Unbalance or Forced Movement into an available Hazard or an adjacent Zone of the character's choice, decided when summoning the tide.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Contest vs. Physical, Any Parry vs. a Conflict Action  
Cost: 1+ Power  
Timing: Declare Step 2, Resolve Step 6  
The character invokes the inevitability of the tides with a continued flurry until the opponent is worn away. If the character wins the Contest, their next Action against the target costs half as much AP.
