# Rising Wave

*The crash is merely the final expression of the power the Wave has always possessed.*  
-- Cycle of Sea and Sky, Book V

## Incarnate Form
Use: Any Wave Shaping Action  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1  
Benefit:  
The character starts an inevitable surge of power that will slowly build, before coming down in a surge of furious power. Instead of resolving as normal, the Action is placed on a Round Delay timer, and placed in a Zone. In exchange, the Tier is Upgraded. This Action can only affect targets within the chosen Zone at the time the Delay ends.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Prepare Action  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1  
Power surges visibly through the character, invoking a sense of foreboding in others. Any observer the character does not have Stealth from knows what Action the Prepare Action will benefit. If the next attempt the character makes (including Passive Reactions) can benefit from these preparations, the Tier of the Prepare bonus is upgraded. If not, the preparations expire unused.
