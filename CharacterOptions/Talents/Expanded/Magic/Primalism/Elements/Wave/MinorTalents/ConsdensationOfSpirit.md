# Condensation of Spirit

*A Tempest brings water where it will.*  
-- Cycle of Sea and Sky, Book III

## Incarnate Form
Use: Acquire Action  
Cost: 1 Effort/Tier  
Timing: Step 1  
Benefit:  
The character rips water from the air, ground, or in the most desperate times manifests it from the Shadow Sea itself. They may use this water for future Wave Shaping attempts in the Scene as if an Asset that provides no Bonus. Without a means of carrying the water without continuous use of Wave Shaping, they lose it at the end of the Scene.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Recovery  
Cost: --  
Timing: --  
The character focuses their will on the present, building up energy like a rising wave. The character may choose to skip their Recovery and instead take a Prepare Action. This happens outside of initiative order and cannot be Reacted to. Alternatively, if they would Recover more APA than they have damaged, the excess becomes a Floating Bonus to be applied to a future attempt.
