Use: Recovery  
Cost: --  
Timing: --  
The character focuses their will on the present, building up energy like a rising wave. The character may choose to skip their Recovery and instead take a Prepare Action. This happens outside of initiative order and cannot be Reacted to. Alternatively, if they would Recover more APA than they have damaged, the excess becomes a Floating Bonus to be applied to a future attempt.
