# Tranquil Reflections

*In the absence of the Wave, the water shows the world rather than itself.*  
-- Scrolls of the Fluid Life, Book III

## Incarnate Form
Use: Successful Wave Shaping Oppose or Parry Reaction  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 11  
Benefit:  
The character catches the power of the countered Action and weaves it into their own flow. They may choose to make an immediate Counterattack, or apply the remaining Power as a Floating Bonus to their next Wave Shaping attempt.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Contest vs. Mental, Any Parry vs. a Conflict Action  
Cost: --  
Timing: Declare Step 2, Resolve Step 6 and/or 11  
The character channels the aspects of reflection and redirection, letting them guide their moves into turning aside the hostile act. If the character wins the Contest, they may either redirect the Conflict Action to a valid third party, or cause it to miss completely.
