The character's mixed attunement allows them to melt and freeze ice and water at will, and manipulate both simultaneously. When using this ability as part of an attempt such as Attack, Obstruct, Initiate/Progress Actions, etc., the player may invest Passion for its normal bonus.

As an Attack, ice attacks use the following weapon profile:  
Core Trait: Powerful or Control, chosen on step 8  
Short Range
Targets: 1 or Target + Splash or All Engaged
Traits: Piercing and Snare

The character couples the implacability of the mountain with the tranquility of calm waters, allowing them to shut out the world and focus on their goals. Instead of Opposing or Parrying the triggering effect, the character applies their Protection and then puts the Action on a Round Delay timer. They may invest Passion to increase their Protection point-for-point.
