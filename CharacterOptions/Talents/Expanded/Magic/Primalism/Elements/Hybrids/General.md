Hybrid Elements are special Talents that may be either Major or Minor, depending on the current Talents mastered by the character. By default, they are Major Talents, but if a character has already mastered both of the associated Elements, they may instead learn it as a Minor Talent. The Shaping Actions of Hybrid Talents may be treated as either or both of their associated Elements for the purposes of any related Minor Talents, ex. a Volcanic Action can be aided by both Flame and Stone Minor Talents.
