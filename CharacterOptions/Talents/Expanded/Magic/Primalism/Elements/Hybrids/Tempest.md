# Tempest Shaping

*When the sea and sky turn to conflict, it is the beaches that are pounded to sand.*  
-- Cycle of Sea and Sky, Book X

If learning as a Major Talent, the character gains access to one of the Font of Magic options listed in either the Wind or Wave Shaping Talents.  
If the character has mastered both of the above Talents, they may learn this as a Minor Talent.

## Incarnate Form
Cost: --    
Timing: Step 1/2  
The character's mixed attunement allows them to call lightning from the skies or conjure bolts into their hands. When using this ability as part of an attempt such as Attack, Obstruct, Initiate/Progress Actions, etc., the character gains a Floating Bonus equal to their current Passion.

As an Attack, lightning attacks use the following weapon profile:  
Core Trait: Swift or Control, chosen on step 7  
Short Range
Targets: 1 or Target + Splash or All Engaged
Traits: Arcing and Shock

## Idealized Concept
Use: Support, after any Conflict Action with Spillover  
Cost: 1 Use   
Timing: Step 12  
The character turns the Lesson of the Tempest to practical use, twisting the violence of one into harm against another. The Spillover applies the Conflict Action (reduced in Tier, as normal) to a third party of the player's choice, as they describe the negligent accident or supernaturally-unlucky fluke of chance or chain reaction of failure that caused the harm to spread to that target.

The character may use this Support during a Scene they are currently in if they can see the Action affected. They may only use it in a Scene they have not Joined if they are declaring an Overwatch role.
