# Consuming Passion
The character gains Passion every time they spend APA on a magical Talent. If they are at their maximum Passion, any additional APA spent on the attempt grants a +2 cumulative Floating Bonus.

## Manifestation
When casting in this tradition, the character's flames flicker and dance fast and hot, as if blown by a bellows, the blast of a furnace, or the raging winds of a wildfire. This tradition manifests as a corona of heat haze that surrounds them and any active magic they maintain, well in excess of the true heat of any flames they have created, and becoming more so as they gain Passion.
