# Dance of Vitality
The character gains Passion on every Action they take. If they are already at their maximum Passion, they may expend all of it to immediately Recover APA. They cannot gain more APA than they had Passion.

## Manifestation
When casting in this tradition, the character's flames flicker and dance slowly and calmly, like a candle or campfire, building from embers to large plumes and back again as they gain and expend Passion. This tradition manifests as billows of smoke and sparks that surround them and any active magic they maintain, even as their true flames burn cleanly.
