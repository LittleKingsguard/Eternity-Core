# Dance of Vitality
The character gains Passion when taking any Primalist Action (but *not* Reactions), or if they have taken any other Action since their last Primalist roll. Alternatively, they may expend all of their uninvested Passion to immediately Recover APA as part of their current attempt. They cannot gain more APA than they had Passion.

## Manifestation
When casting in this tradition, the character's flames flicker and dance slowly and calmly, like a candle or campfire, building from embers to large plumes and back again as they gain and expend Passion. This tradition manifests as billows of smoke and sparks that surround them and any active magic they maintain, even as their true flames burn cleanly.
