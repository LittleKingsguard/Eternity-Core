-- Path of Dancing Light, Book II

Before choosing from the below options, the character gains access to one of the following Font of Magic options:

Timing: Step 1/2  
The character's impulsive drive wills the Flame to manifest physically in the form of blasts of fire. These can be flames as small as a candle or sweeping blasts as large as the character can stand to channel. When using these fires as part of an attempt, the character gains a Floating Bonus equal to their current Passion and may Upgrade that attempt by paying 1 Effort or APA.

When used for attacks, obstacle destruction, etc., the flames are Lethal against anything that burns, or is particularly susceptible to high heat.  
In combat, the flames use the following weapon profile:  
Core Trait: Lethal (see above)  
Short Range  
Targets: Target + Splash or All Engaged  
Traits: Wash  

## Idealized Concept
Cost: -- or 1 E/APA  
Timing: Step 1/2  
The Flame feeds on the character's impulsive desire, and burns away their hesistation. As a passive effect, their Initiative always starts equal to the lowest of their Primalism ratings before spending AP, instead of 0. When taking Actions and not Opposed by a character with equal or greater Initiative, the character gains a Floating Bonus equal to their current Passion and may Upgrade that Action by paying 1 Effort or APA.
