## Idealized Concept
Use: Social Influence or Control attempt  
Cost: 1 AP  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
The character multitasks an additional Control Action forcing the target to attempt to repeat the original Influence or Control attempt against other targets. Any repetitions also benefit from this Talent, until a target successfully Opposes the attempt or rejects the Control Dilemma. If the original attempt was also a Control effect, the character chooses which one the target has to complete first.
