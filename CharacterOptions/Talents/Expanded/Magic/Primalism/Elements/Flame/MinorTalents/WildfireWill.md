# Wildfire Will

*The Flame is expansion, for it defies the darkness that tries to confine its light, and spreads to illuminate the faintest shadow.*  
-- Path of Dancing Light, Book IV

## Incarnate Form
Use: Any Flame Shaping Action  
Cost: 1 Effort/APA  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
The character's flames affect all targets equally, being a full Area blast instead of a Splash attack.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Social Influence or Control attempt  
Cost: 1 AP  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
The character multitasks an additional Control Action forcing the target to attempt to repeat the original Influence or Control attempt against other targets. Any repetitions also benefit from this Talent, until a target successfully Opposes the attempt or rejects the Control Dilemma. If the original attempt was also a Control effect, the character chooses which one the target has to complete first.
