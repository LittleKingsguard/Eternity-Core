# Controlled Burn

*#57: Do not light off big fireballs in small rooms.*  
-- 88 Axioms for the Adventurous Aetherborn

If the character gains the Idealized Concept version of Flame Shaping and already knows [Controlled Connection](../../../General/ControlledConnection.md), they gain this Talent for free.

## Incarnate Form
Character gains [Controlled Connection](../../../General/ControlledConnection.md) if they would unlock the Incarnate Form after learning this Talent.

## Idealized Concept
Use: When targeted by any effect leveraging one of the character's Intimacies  
Cost: 1+ APA or SPA  
Timing: Step 8  
Benefit:  
The character wields the Primal Flame against their own temptations, temporarily burning away emotional connections that would lead them astray. The character may spend 1 APA each to ignore a Minor Intimacy for the rest of the Scene, or 1 SPA to ignore a Major Intimacy.
