# Building Inferno

*Even the fires of the greatest suns begin with a single spark.*  
-- Codex of the Burning Soul, Book V

## Incarnate Form
Use: Special Move  
Range: As normal for Flame Shaping  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1  
Benefit:  
The character may create an Inferno Seed as an Obstruct Action. This is a Hazard that the player may choose to detonate as a Round Delay Attack targeting the entire Zone. A character threatened by the Hazard when the blast goes off has any Difficulty vs. targeting them negated as if spending a Tier.  
If the explosion's tier is greater than the Scene's level of Escalation, the Zone becomes Hazardous terrain.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Special Move  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1  
The character makes a Prepare Action benefitting any Conflict Action against a target. They gain the resulting Bonus on all valid subsequent Actions until the character no longer has Engagement/Suppression on the target.
