# Earth's Embrace
The character gains Passion every time they take a Prepare Action, Assist an allied character, or Oppose an Action targeting an ally, or if they have taken any such Action/Reaction since their last Primalism roll. When Assisting a character, they may expend Passion to grant a +1 Floating Bonus to the target character for each point spent.

## Manifestation
When casting in this tradition, the ground flows like sand and loose soil, and even large and solid boulders are thrown gracefully and smoothly. This tradition manifests with the plinking feeling of loose windblown sand, and the feeling of the ground settling underfoot even if the perceiving character is standing on hard stone or elevated floors.
