# Enduring Rock
The character gains Passion if, as part of their current Action or since their last Primalism roll, they take a Guard or Prepare Action, refused a Dilemma, or were targeted by a Conflict Action they did not React to. They may spend Passion on step 9 of any Action targeting them, regradless of whether they Reacted, increasing their Protection by 2 per point spent.

## Manifestation
When casting in this tradition, the movements are jerky and sudden, and earth and stone move in as large and solid masses as possible. This tradition manifests with tremors underfoot, matching the bursts of motion in their magic, the pace of their stride, and faintly, the calm and steady beat of their heart (or equivalent).
