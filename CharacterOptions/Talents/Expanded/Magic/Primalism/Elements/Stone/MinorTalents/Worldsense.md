*The Mountain stands eternal, witness to all that has ever been, and all that ever will.*  
-- Codex of the Everlasting Mountain, Book VII

## Incarnate Form
Use: Discover/Investigate attempts  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
The character is attuned to the sensations of the earth. While in contact with earth, stone, or similar, they may use Stone Shaping as part of an attempt to perceive their surroundings. This ignores any ordinary concealment or cover interrupting line-of-sight, but can only detect targets in direct or indirect contact with the ground. Either the character or any targets being indirectly connected (ex. inside a wooden building) may constitute cover for the purposes of this attempt.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Attempt benefitting from a Prepare or Guard Action  
Cost: 1 APA
Timing: Step 1/2  
Attunement to the timeless aspect of the Prinal Stone gives the character insight into the past and future. The character gains Foresight on the attempt.
