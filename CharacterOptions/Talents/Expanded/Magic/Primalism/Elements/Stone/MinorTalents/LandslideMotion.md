# Landslide Motion

*The tools of support can become the strings of control.*  
-- Law of Earthly Foundations, Book VI

## Incarnate Form
Use: Any attempt, Contest vs. Physical  
Cost: 1+ Effort  
Timing: Declare Step 1/2, Resolve Step 6  
Benefit:  
The character controls the ground their opponent walks on, exerting their will on their motion. If the character wins the Contest, they may choose to either control the distance for an Attack (either theirs or their opponent's) or inflict a Dilemma vs. forced movement.

## Idealized Concept
Use: When forcing movement on a target  
Cost: 1 AP 
Timing: Step 10  
The character makes a quick but powerful follow-up move that carries with it the inexorable gravitic aspect of the Primal Stone. The distance the target is forced to move is upgraded. This may also upgrade the damage of a Dilemma if refused, or instead be used to ise the overall Tier for the purposes of overcoming Reactions or DT.
