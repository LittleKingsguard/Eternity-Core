# Earthbreaker

*Inherent to Earth is the inexorable pull by which all things are drawn into it. In this, its solid nature stands in opposition. The unbroken rock cannot pull anything within.*  
-- Law of Earthly Foundations, Book III

## Incarnate Form
Use: Any Stone Shaping Action  
Cost: 1+ Dice, 1+ Power  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
The character manipulates the ground they drew the material of their attack from, leaving pits of jagged spikes, unstable rubble, or even pulverizing it to a mire of fine sand. This multitasks an Obstruct Action as part  of their original roll, adding a new Obstacle or Hazard to the target's Zone or turning it into Difficult Terrain. The D/R of the feature is equal to half the Dice/Power expended.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Unbalancing a target, or using a gravity-based Hazard against them  
Cost: 1 AP  
Timing: Step 12  
The character continues through the attack with a mighty follow-through, driving them literally into the ground. On a Success, the target is trapped behind an Obstacle of equal Tier to the Action that buried them, and cannot move or rise from Prone until they overcome it.
