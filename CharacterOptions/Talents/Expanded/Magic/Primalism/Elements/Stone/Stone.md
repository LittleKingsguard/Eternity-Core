# Stone Shaping

*Among the countless planes of the Cosmos, one may find forgotten realms lost to darkness, as even the stars themselves have failed the test of time. And yet, even in these benighted places, one constant remains: The Stone endures.*  
-- Codex of the Everlasting Mountain, Book II: Endurance

Before choosing from the below options, the character gains access to one of the following Font of Magic options:
* Enduring Rock
* Earth's Embrace

## Incarnate Form
Cost: -- or 1 AP/Effort    
Timing: Step 1/2  
The character's attunement to the Prinal Shape of Stone allows them to manipulate the earth and rock around them. When using this ability as part of an attempt such as Attack, Obstruct, Initiate/Progress Actions, etc., the character gains a Floating Bonus equal to their current Passion and may Upgrade that attempt by paying 1 Effort or AP.

As an Attack, rock attacks use the following weapon profile:  
Core Trait: Powerful  
Short Range
Targets: 1
Traits: Forceful

## Idealized Concept
Cost: --   
Timing: Step 2  
The Stone butresses the character's form and resolve, granting them the power to stand firm. As a passive effect, their Defense Tier is increased by 1 for all purposes. When taking Passive Reactions (ex. from Armor or Guard Actions), the character gains a floating bonus equal to their Passion.
