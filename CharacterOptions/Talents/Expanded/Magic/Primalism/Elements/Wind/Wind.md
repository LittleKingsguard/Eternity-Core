# Wind Shaping

*When the fire has burned away, the seas have boiled away, and the wind-blown sand has worn the mountain flat, the Winds will still blow over an empty world. Consider: That which never had form may never lose it.*  
-- Chant of Ceaseless Breath, First Scroll

Before choosing from the below options, the character gains access to one of the following Tradition options:
* Eternal Breeze
* Sudden Gust

## Incarnate Form
Cost: -- or 1 AP/Effort    
Timing: Step 1/2  
The character's attunement to the Primal Shape of Wind allows them to manipulate the air around them. When using this ability as part of an attempt such as Attack, Obstruct, Initiate/Progress Actions, etc., the player may Upgrade that attempt by paying 1 Effort or AP.

As an Attack, wind attacks use the following weapon profile:  
Core Trait: Swift  
Short Range
Targets: 1
Traits: Subtle

## Idealized Concept
Cost: --   
Timing: Step 2  
The Wind fills the character's spirits and lightens their stride, making them harder to pin down both literally and metaphorically. As a passive effect, their Defense Tier is raised against all Dilemma efects, and if they would be subjected to an unwanted Condition, they may treat it as one degree weaker by investing 2 Passion per such Conidtion.
