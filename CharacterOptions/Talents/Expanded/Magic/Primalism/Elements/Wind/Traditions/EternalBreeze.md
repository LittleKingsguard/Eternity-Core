# Eternal Breeze
Rather that gain or expend Passion, the character may treat their current Passion as half their max at all times.

## Manifestation
When casting in this tradition, the air is constantly in motion, and seems unnaturally prone to carrying dust, leaves, litter, etc. with it. This tradition manifests with a feeling of wind emanating from the caster, regardless of which way the magic is being directed, and smelling faintly of exotic lands (wherever the perceiving character considers exotic).
