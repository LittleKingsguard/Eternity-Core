Rather that gain or expend Passion, the character may treat their current Passion as half their max, unless they have invoked an Intimacy or had one of theirs successfully leveraged by an Influence/Control/etc. Action since their last Recovery. This counts as increasing their Passion for the purposes of Primalist Talents, including satisfying the condition to use them.

## Manifestation
When casting in this tradition, the air is constantly in motion, and seems unnaturally prone to carrying dust, leaves, litter, etc. with it. This tradition manifests with a feeling of wind emanating from the caster, regardless of which way the magic is being directed, and smelling faintly of exotic lands (wherever the perceiving character considers exotic).
