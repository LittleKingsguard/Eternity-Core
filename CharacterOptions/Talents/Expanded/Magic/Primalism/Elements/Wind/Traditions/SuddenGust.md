# Sudden Gust
Rather than gaining and expending Passion, the character may choose to treat their Passion as if it were its maximum value for a single roll. When they do, the sudden burst of speed catches other characters Off-Guard if they did not know the character had this Tradition, or Surprised if they did. This counts as increasing their Passion for the purposes of Primalist Talents, including satisfying the condition to use them.

Afterwards, the character cannot use this ability again until they Recover.

## Manifestation
When casting in this tradition, the air shifts un an unnatural stillness, excpet for what the mage controls. This tradition manifests with a shockwave-like impacts of air against those around. While incapable of actually harming them, very strong manifestations might knock the wind out of bystanders as they instinctively respond to the illusion of danger.
