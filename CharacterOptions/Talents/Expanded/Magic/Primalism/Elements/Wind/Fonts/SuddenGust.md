# Sudden Gust
Rather than gaining and expending Passion, the character may choose to treat their Passion as if it were its maximum value for a single roll. When they do, the sudden burst of speed catches other characters Off-Guard if they did not know the character had this Font of Power, or Surprised if they did.

Afterwards, the character cannot use this ability again until they Recover.
