# Prevailing Winds

*Where there is focus, there is imbalance. Where there is imbalance, there is the Wind to follow that path.*  
-- Chant of Ceaseless Breath, First Scroll

## Incarnate Form
Use: Any Wind Shaping Conflict Action  
Cost: 1+ Effort/APA  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
The targets of the Action remain Suppressed by a constant stream of wind even after the initial blast. This continues until the character uses this Talent again or has made Reactions using the Suppression equal to the cost paid.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Reaction vs. Prone or Forced Movement Dilemma  
Cost: 1+ Effort  
Timing: Step 2  
If the character would be knocked Prone/Tumbled, or has movement forced on them, they may reduce the Tier of the movement or degree of the Condition by 1 per Effort spent. However, the character subjects themselves to a Control Dilemma compelling them to move into a different Zone on their next Action. This Dilemma has the same Power/Tier as the triggering Dilemma.
