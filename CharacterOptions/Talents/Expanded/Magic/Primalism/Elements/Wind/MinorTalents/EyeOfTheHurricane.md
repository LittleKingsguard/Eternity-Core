# Eye of the Hurricane

*The heart of the storm is calm, and kept so by its fury.*  
-- Principles of Sublime Motion, Book XI

## Incarnate Form
Use: Guard Action  
Cost: --  
Timing: Declare Step 1  
Benefit:  
The character creates a wall of furious winds that whirl around them, turning aside arrows and fire alike. The Guard action the character takes applies only against ranged attacks, but is only ended when the they take another Wind Shaping Action, allowing them to take any other Actions freely.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Oppose Reaction vs. Social or similar Dilemma  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1  
The character whips their own emotions and desires to a frenzy, overwhelming and sweeping aside the meager attempts to sway them. The character raises their DT against the triggering Conflict by 1. However, they inflict upon themselves a Control Dilemma of the same Power and Tier as the source, compelling them to make their next Action a bold and dramatic advance in favor of one of their Intimacies.
