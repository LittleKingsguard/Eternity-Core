# Rising Cloud

*Every storm was once merely another cloud.*  
-- Principles of Sublime Motion, Book VII

## Incarnate Form
Use: Assist Reaction or Attack/Obstruct/other Action involving throwing things skyward  
Cost: 0+ Power  
Timing: Declare Step 1/2, Resolve Step 12  
Benefit:  
The character creates an updraft that flings another character or object into the air.  
As an Assist, the target character is Flying during the Assisted Action.  
Against hostile characters the player may choose to pay Power. In addition to the Attack, the target is affected by a Forced Movement Dilemma of Power equal to double the Power spent, using the same roll to hit and Opposed by the same Reaction. If the target takes damage from the Attack, they face an additional Dilemma vs. Prone on Step 12, using the damage taken as the Power.

## Idealized Concept
Use: Any non-sustained Action involving movement  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1  
The character brings their will to the sky, and leaps into the air. During the Action, they are Flying.
