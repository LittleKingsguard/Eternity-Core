# Void

*The Primal Shapes, Anima, and all other such mystical things of the Aetheric Sea, while wondrously, impossibly complex, are still foundationally as much Aether as the simplest spell. Many practitioners of these Arts do not understand that right up until that 'novice spell' simply turns their wonders off.*  
-- Grimoire of Emptiness, Chapter III

Base Effect:

Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1/2
Range: Self or All Engaged  
Benefit:  
The mage pushes away the Aether that surrounds them, cutting off any other magics they might cast or sustain, but heavily suppressing the magics of others in the area in the process. The roll is upgraded one Tier and, if Guarding, Counters all currently active magic in the affected area.

The mage cannot use any magical Ability until their next Action, except to make another Reaction using this effect.

As Spell component:
Cost: --
Benefit: Special Contest vs. any Magic
Instantly after the continued effects of the spell have been reduced to simple physics (ex. a telekinetically-thrown weapon, a spacewarping redirect, etc.), the spell concludes with a suppression field. If any Opposing character is using any magical Ability for their roll, the Tier of their attempt is reduced by 1.

After casting this spell, the mage cannot use any magical Ability until their next Action, except the above base effect.
