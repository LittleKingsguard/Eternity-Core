# Flare

*Those Physically-minded of you may have heard that Aether is so tricky to channel because it expands like a gas to fill all spaces into which it is allowed. This is close enough to correct for a pre-Initiation class. You may have also heard that Flaring makes this easier by 'condensing' it, so that it flows denser and more liquid. This is far less correct, but in ways unlikely to harm you were you to experience it for yourselves, so we will revisit that discussion in the graduate classes.*

Aether gathers around the mage, producing an aura unmistakeable to Spirits or magically-initiated Mortals, but still apparent, if subtle, to others. The usual manifestations are an apparent brightness and the colors growing far more vivid and saturated, sometimes ever seeming to drain away from the surroundings, combined with the sense of an illusory inwards breeze, as Aether rushes toward the center. At greater powers (beginning in the Tier III-IV range), this aura becomes physically real, as the Aether becomes so dense as to begin spontaneously jumping across the Gap, forming a corona of ephemeral Free and associated simple magical effects, such as flashes of static electricity, luminescent glows, telekinetic pressure, etc. These are not necessarily harmless, but rarely a concern for any mage capable of such power in the first place.

Base Effect:

## Empower
Use: Prepare Action or Assist  
Cost: 1 Flux  
Timing: Step 1/2
Range: Self or All Engaged  
Benefit:  
The mage compresses the Aether surrounding them, incrasing the density and allowing themselves or another nearby to channel greater amounts of power safely. The Prepare or Assist may benefit any magical roll of any type.

## Charge
Use: Miscellaneous  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1
Range: Self  
Benefit:  
The mage takes control of the flow of Aether through them, and seeks to intensify the stream. They may return to their starting Flux value, and may choose to gain more Flux, up to the number of Successes or half the total Power.

As Spell component:
Cost: +1 SP
Benefit: Flux cost is decreased by 2
The time cost of casting the spell is increased, as the remainder of the spell will be disrupted by the flowing Aether if cast before the Flare is complete. Despite this, the power gains are frequently worth the trade.
