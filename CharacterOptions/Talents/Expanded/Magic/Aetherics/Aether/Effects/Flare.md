# Flare

*Those Physically-minded of you may have heard that Aether is so tricky to channel because it expands like a gas to fill all spaces into which it is allowed. This is close enough to correct for a pre-Initiation class. You may have also heard that Flaring makes this easier by 'condensing' it, so that it flows denser and more liquid. This is far less correct, but in ways unlikely to harm you were you to experience it for yourselves, so we will revisit that discussion in the graduate classes.*

Base Effect:
Use: Prepare Action or Assist  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1/2
Range: Self or All Engaged  
Benefit:  
The mage compresses the Aether surrounding them, incrasing the density and allowing themselves or another nearby to channel greater amounts of power safely. The Prepare or Assist may benefit any magical roll of any type.

As Spell component:
Cost: +1 SP
Benefit: +3 Power
The time cost of casting the spell is increased, as the remainder of the spell will be disrupted by the flowing Aether if cast before the Flare is complete. Despite this, the power gains are frequently worth the trade.
