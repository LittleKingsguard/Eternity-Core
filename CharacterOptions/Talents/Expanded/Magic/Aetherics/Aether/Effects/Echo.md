*That which is magic touches the Aether, including the Soul. The teachings of the Eternal Scholar tell us what can be touched can be known, and that knowledge is contagious.*  
-- Master Triemis, Wandering Academic

Like most pure Aether effects, another mage or Spirit will instantly recognize the pulse for what it is, though one not familiar with Aetheric magic might not understand the use of it. It manifests like a deep bass soundwave of the sort that gets felt in the chest as much as the ear, and stronger pulses can rattle the teeth or knock wind from people like a nearby explosion.

Base Effect:
Use: Discover Action to locate a target, or Guard against Stealth attempts  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1/2
Range: Own Zone  
Benefit:  
The mage casts out a pulse of Aether, and feels the direction of any waves bouncing back. They detect all infused items or active spells in the target area, unless on the body of a character that remains Hidden, and ignores all concealment when Discovering them or ensouled beings. This cannot detect purely mundane physical objects.

As Spell component:
Cost: 2+ Power
Benefit: The spell incorporates an aether pulse into its casting trigger, using timing and trigonometry to determine the angle and distance to a detected target before firing. While this consumes a great deal of aether on what is ultimately an accessory effect, accuracy is greatly improved.

At 2 Power spent, the spell ignores Concealment. For each additional 2 Power spent, the spell gains an automatic success. The mage must still know who they are trying to shoot and have an idea of where they are, or at least be willing to fire indiscriminately at the nearest available target.
