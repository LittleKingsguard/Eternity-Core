The Action of Force is more formally referred to as the practice of manipulating matter, and in this application it serves to empower the natural bonds that hold it together. To a degree, this happens as a natural consequence of infusing matter with magical forces regardless of the discipline used (hence why magical equipment tends to be more durable), though deliberate effort using this technique is far stronger. In manifestation, this creates glowing lines where the forces against the object are strongest, often resulting in the impression of a wireframe model tracing the edges and corners.
