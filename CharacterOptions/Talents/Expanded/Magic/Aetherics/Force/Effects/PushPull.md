# Push/Pull

*1. Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.*  
*2. The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.*  
*3. To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction; or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.*  
-- The First Incarnation's Guide to the Physical Realm, Chapter II: Natural Laws

Commonly referred to as telekinesis, this action influences the motion of the caster and other objects, though the relatively limited control inherent to Aethericist methods makes any use of direction outside the line of the caster a tool only of the more sophisticated spells, or very experienced mages. Generally speaking, most spells under this Action use both push and pull in equal measure, directing that which they didn't intend to use to practical effect into the earth or sky (as this is standard, it is already accounted for in cost). Mages who break this pattern quickly learn why, when the recoil of their spell sends them flying across the room. Manifestations are usually subtle, thin lines of of light tracing out the direction of force, and the whistling of air similar to an arrow's travel.

Base Effect:

## Push
Use: Any relevant  
Cost: 1+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1/2
Range: Short  
Traits: Subtle, Scaling 2  
Benefit:  
Force is directed away from the caster towards a target object or character, throwing loose objects across the room and shoving larger ones such as characters and obstacles. This may be used as a Physical Parry by pushing back Attacks and similar Actions. When used for an Attack, the player may choose to throw an available item or Gear Asset, in which case the profile for the Asset is used. If the projectile has no profile, instead choose the most relevant Core Trait and any two other traits. Alternatively, the player may choose to use force directly, using the following profile:
Core Trait: Control  
Short Range  
Targets: Target  
Traits: Piercing, Subtle  

## Push
Use: Any relevant  
Cost: 1+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1
Range: Short  
Traits: Subtle, Scaling 2  
Benefit:  
Force calls out from the caster towards a target, yanking them closer. This pulls minor items or loose Gear to hand, and can wrench Obstacles free or manhandle other characters. When used for an Attack, this uses the following profile:
Core Trait: Control  
Short Range  
Targets: Target  
Traits: Piercing, Subtle  

As Spell component:
Use: After spell effect makes an item (ex. with Shadow or Create) or creates a blast
Cost: Equal to base effect cost
Benefit: The created object is immediately catapulted towards a target(s), giving the effect Short Range. If it created a Blast instead, it targets an adjacent Zone as a Cone.
