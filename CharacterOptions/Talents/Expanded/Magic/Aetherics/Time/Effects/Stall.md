*Time is like a river; it only flows downhill. Also like a river, it may be dammed with great effort.*  
-- Grimoire of the Eternal Flow, Chapter II

To put time on pause is a daunting task, and, technically speaking, not actually possible. A competent Aethericist may come arbitrarily close, however, forming a region that appears from the outside to be frozen still. Actually making this region large enough to contain anything significant is an act of incredible power, however, and most mages are forced to limit themselves to using the effect as a shield. The manifestation is most notable in color and a certain atmosphere it casts on its surroundings, with the frozen space appearing in reddish-brown tones and the surrounding air feeling unnaturally still even in the presence of wind.

Base Effects:  

## Barrier
Use: Parry Reaction or Guard/Obstruct Action  
Cost: 1+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Range: Short  
Traits: Sustained, Scaling, Breakable  
Benefit:  
The mage grinds the flow of time to a near-standstill in a narrow ribbon of space, and anything possessed of inertial mass slams to a halt upon entering the space as the time component of of its velocity (and thus conserved momentum) becomes impossibly brief. While sufficient force may overtax the spell and collapse it, the intense temporal gradient may cause things to be ripped apart by their own kinetic energy, and so any Obstacles created using his effect are also Hazards.

## Freeze
Use: Conflict Action  
Cost: 2+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Short  
Traits: Flux-Limited, Delay, Breakable  
Benefit:  
Applied over a larger area, the spell attempts to freeze objects or characters into a single moment in time. Unattended objects (including Assets and Hazards) do nothing for a number of Initative counts equal to half the Flux paid on this effect. Additionally:  
If the spell would deal APA damage to a target character, the target may instead pay Effort equal to half the Flux spent on this effect.  
If the spell would deal SPA damage to a target character, the target may instead pay AP equal to half the Flux spent on this effect, and is frozen for the same number of Initiative counts.  
If the spell would deal NPA damage to a target character, the target may instead choose to be frozen for the remainder of the Scene and lose Spotlight equal to half the Flux spent on this effect.

Finally, a Barrier effect as above protects the targets, and the spell ends if it is broken.

As Spell component:

## Delay
Use: Making a spell complete at a later time than it is cast
Cost: 1 Flux, Sustained
Benefit: Just after charging the spell, the mage pauses time, stretching the microseconds of its casting into macro-scale times. The spell does not go off until the mage ceases to sustain the spell, or the temporal pause is disrupted as a Miscellaneous Action.
