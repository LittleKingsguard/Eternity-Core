# Decelerate

*A broken clock is right sometimes, but a slow clock never is.*  
-- The Art of Artifice, Chapter IV: Calibrations

Working under the same principles as Stalling but far less extreme, the deceleration of time creates a space where things seem to move in slow motion, and the world seems faster from within. The manifestations are also similar to Stalling, casting the area in tones of red and brown, as well as darkening and reddening any light emanating from within.

Base Effects:  
Use: Obstruct Action  
Cost: 2+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Range: Short  
Target: Hazard  
Traits: Sustained, Scaling  
Benefit:  
The flow of time slows in an area, making movement slower and sapping the force those within can exert. All characters Threatened by the new Hazard suffer Blitz penalties as if their Initiative was 1 lower for ever 2 Flux spent, and the Hazard Opposes *all* rolls made by those inside, or Aids rolls made against them by those outside. Neither applies when affected characters target other affected characters.

As Spell component:

## Delay
Use: Making a targeted spell harder to avoid
Range: Short
Cost: 2+ Flux
Benefit: While aiming the spell, the mage slows time for the target area, making it easier to aim and harder to avoid. For each 2 Flux spent on this effect, the target treats their Initiave as 1 lower for the burpose of Blitz penalties, and the spell gains +1 Dice when casting.
