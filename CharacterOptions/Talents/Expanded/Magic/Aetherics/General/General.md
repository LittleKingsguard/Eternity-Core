Because Aethericists at least have a passing familiarity with all of the Actions by necessity, they more easily pursue power and skill through general study than do other mages. In particular, the initiation Talents are always General, and the specialized Talents for each Action build off of that foundation. A generalsit can use and ever create spells with any Action, even ones for which they have no associated Talents, though their work will fall far short of an equivalently powerful specialist.
