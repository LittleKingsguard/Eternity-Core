A Mnemonic Ward pairs the Conduit with another advanced and dangerous piece of Soul Reconstruction, hijacking the free association of memory to tie a single gesture, a spoken word, musical sequence, or some other trigger to the eidetic image of the desired spell. Traditionally, this rewired instinctive connection then manifests the spell in harmless runes of light by Action of Energy, so that the caster may proofread their work in the proces of perfecting the spell and casting method. A particularly confident mage may instead choose to write in invisible Aether, and a reckless one could even cast directly from the mental image alone. In any case, the method is legendarily quick, and battlemages so using their spells have a gunslinger's reputation for instant violence.

Such spells cannot be bought or traded directly, at least not without esoteric Animist practices most Aethericists are wary of. A mage cannot have more such spells than the sum of their Aether ratings, and Acquiring a new one, either by their own work or by adapting a spell from a different Tradition, requires paying 1 SPA as part of the Project due to the mental remodeling involved.  
However, all such Spells are Readied by default, the completely internal nature of the spell encoding makes it impossible to disarm the caster of it, and they can only be made Open or Unready if they are physically prevented from completing the mnemonic trigger.
