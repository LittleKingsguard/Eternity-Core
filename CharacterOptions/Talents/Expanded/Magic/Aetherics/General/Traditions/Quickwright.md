Rather than learn tricks for memorizing a spell, or means of casting one from a hardcopy form, the Quickwright is an almost pure improviser, with a personal suite of eclectic runes and spell subcomponents that have meaning only in their own mind and which frequently horrify more formal spellwrights. Quickwrights don't really learn spells, per se. They might think of other mage's spells as useful inspiration, and most of them could probably manage to cast from a prepared glyph if given enough time to draw it themselves, but these are rarely useful enough reasons to justify carrying them around. If they need a spell for something, they'll usually just... make it.

Spells for the Quickwright tradition cannot be Acquired. Instead, the mage may start a Project to Acquire a temporary Spell for the duration of the Scene, and all Actions to advance it are Upgraded, in addition to the normal Tier upgrade for using the Aether Ability and associated Major Talents. When attempting to complete the Project, they may choose on Step 1 to cast the spell as part of the same Action at no extra cost. However, if they fail to complete the Project, they take Overflow damage equal to the margin of failure.
