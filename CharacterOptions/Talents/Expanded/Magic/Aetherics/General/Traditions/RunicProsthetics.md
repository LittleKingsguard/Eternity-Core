This method combines the network of tattoos or wire with full-replacement prosthetics, giving the character artificial limbs and body parts in the place of missing or surgically removed originals. Each new part contains a spell relevant to its form, such as an artificial eye providing Aethersight, or a hand granting simple telekinesis. Each one can be anything from a clockwork wonder of artifice to a simple collection of free-floating metal or crystal only made mobile by action of Force. The mechanism is largely irrelevant, as part of the process of learning the associated spell is reshaping the mage's internal landscape to "wire in" the mental function of the old limb to control the new part. While the adjestment period is often long and unpleasant, the prosthetic often becomes an upgrade after all the magic and rehabilitation is complete.

When "learning" an new spell like this, the character also gains a related Gear Asset of the same base stats that cannot be disarmed without an NPA-level Dilemma. This Asset benefits rolls related to the limb it replaces, such as perception using an artificial eye.
