# Runic Body

*By my spirit, I purge myself of these flaws.*  
*By my focus, I heal myself of these wounds.*
*By my will, I replace old scars with newfound strength.*
*By my word, I replace old ties with newfound purpose.*
-- Order of the Argent Shield, Initiation Rites

Rather than maintain conscious control, the initiating mage draws the connection fully through the soul to outflow into the body itself, using techniques similar to the infusion of magical gear to place additional control on the aether conducting through them. While this is far less risky to the mage and in some ways far more powerful, it heavily limits their options for creative use, as the magic will now only do what its runic bindings instruct.

The character gains access to one of the following Tradition options:
* Runic Tattoos
* Runic Implants
* Runic Prosthetics

The character cannot directly cast any spells they have acquired. Instead, they may imbue one into their body to "learn" it permanently when they learn any Aetheric Talent, including this one. Once they have done so, the spell cannot be disarmed or destroyed without the character's permission. If the spell is a persistent effect, the character may choose to turn it on or off as part of any action. When using any learned spell, the Action is upgraded one Tier.
