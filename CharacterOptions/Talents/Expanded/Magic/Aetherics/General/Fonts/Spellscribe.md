A mage accustomed to the Scribe method of spellcasting is the archetypical scholarly type, with their craft stored away in tomes and scrolls. The size, legibility, and ease of transport of such encodings make this a quite convenient method for acquiring and storing a great many spells, at least as long as one doesn't have to find the right page in the midst of chaos. While any Aethericist is capable of reading such a spell, what definites a spellscribe is some trick for readying a spell for casting directly from the page, such as a thoroughly-memorized spell for copying the inert writing into glowing and active runes of light, or an eidetic short-term memory that can visualize the written spell clearly enough to cast from the mental image.

At the start of a Scene, a Spellscribe may spend 2 Agency/Impact or 1 Resources per spell to declare they have acquired any new Spell they can cast without Overflow. Hoever, they may only have one spell Readied for casting at a time, and require a Miscellaneous Action to swap between available spells. Once Readied, the spell can be cast without the physical notes, but the mage cannot Ready a spell they do not have on hand to read.
