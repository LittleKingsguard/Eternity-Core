Closely related to Runecraft, Artifice is a practice that blends the casting methods of Runecraft with otherwise purely Physical mechanisms and alchemy, producing such wonders as engines that run on the principles of flame conjuration, cranes that lift by telekinetic force, and rifles that fire shadowsteel bullets. This blending of mundane and magical science produces spells that are more finicky, more vulnerable, more expensive, and more cumbersome than other means, as crude matter rarely matches the mathematical perfection of a well-crafted spell in refinement and precision. But by the same token, the spell is also not being asked to do all of the work, and thus they are more efficient.

Each spell made for this method is also a Gear Asset, and so when Acquiring them the mage must spend a Tier to multitask its creation. In exchange, casting gains the Dice/Power bonuses for both the Spell and the Gear Asset.
