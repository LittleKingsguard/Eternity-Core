A Ward is a long-lasting, persistent spell that passively supports and empowers the mage (or more rarely, given the limitations of Aethercraft, other allies). A Wardsmith, then, is a mage who specializes in such spells, often to the neglect of their spot casting skills.

At the start of any Scene, including ones they are targets of but not actively Joining, the Wardsmith may choose a known persistent spell to have active. If they have actively Joined or Initiated the Scene, they may spend 2 Agency/Impact or 1 Resources each to have other such spells active as well. Finally, all such spells have the required Tier to Counter or Destroy them raised by 1.
