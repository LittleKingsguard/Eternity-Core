Overflow is the mental and spiritual damage a mage sustains for attempting to channel more Aether than they can safely control, as the power begins to spill out of the defined conduit the mage has created through their soul and washing through parts of their mind not yet fortified against such energies, like a river overtopping the levees of a town.

A character suffers Overflow if they meet perform any of the following during an Aether Action:
* Spending Effort to add Dice or Power, taking 1 APA per Effort spent.
* Invoking an Imitmacy for a Floating Bonus, 1 APA per each.
* Using a Spell with greater Dice or Power than their Aether Rating, 1 APA per point in difference.

If a character uses a Spell of greater Tier than they can manage without its Bonus, the damage is upgraded once per each Tier in difference, and can cannot be below 1.
