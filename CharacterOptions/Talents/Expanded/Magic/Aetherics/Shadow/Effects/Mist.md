# Mist

*The vapors that fill the Shadow Sea in their unmolested state are the purest expression of matter, and thus the most indistinct.*  
-- Void Body Teachings, Book V

Shadowmist is substance of the Shadow Sea, and when summoned into a physical plane it appears as a night-black cloud of smoke, cold enough to frost the breath. The exact properties of the mist are subject to the whims of the caster, (presuming they know what they're doing), but most commonly mirrors that of the surrounding air, hanging in place like a cloud. Like most of the Shadowsmith's arts, the manifestations of the Mist are rarely more noticeable than the cloud that is conjured forth.

Base Effects:  

## Cloud
Use: Miscellaneous Action  
Cost: 1 Flux/Zone  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Short  
Target: Zone(s)  
Traits: Sustained, Overt  
Benefit:  
The mage draws the Shadow Sea into the Physical Realm, filling the air with black clouds. Light cannot penetrate the clouds except by burning them away completely (a Counter Action), and by extension, characters dependent on light are Blinded.

## Blast
Use: Conflict Action  
Cost: 1+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Self  
Target: Blast  
Traits: Scaling  
Benefit:  
The spell draws forth mist in a sudden, intense flow, washing outwards from the caster in a mighty and chill wind. This creates a Blast effect centered on (but not affecting) the caster, using the following profile:
Core Trait: Swift  
Blast  
Traits: Wash, Cold

The caster may choose to Sustain the spell as a Cloud effect in the targeted area.


As Spell component:

## Vaporize
