Flux is the amount of Aether the character can safely channel during a given time, and thus a measure of how many spells they can cast, and how powerful those spells can be.

Any character with access to the Aetherics Ability also gains Flux at the start of the Scene equal to the highest of their Aetherics ratings. They calculate their soft/hard cap similarly to AP/Effort using this rating and their choice of any others used during Scene Initiation for Agency/Impact. 

Unlike AP/Effort, characters do not regain Flux at the start of a new round. Instead, they may regain it at the end of a round by skipping their Recovery, or by invoking the Aether Flare effect. They may also spend Effort to gain two Flux per point spent, which may be done while declaring an Action or Reaction. If this takes the character above their starting value or soft cap, the character takes Overflow damage as below.

# Overflow
If the caster declares an Action or Reaction while they have more than their starting Flux, they take APA for each point of difference. If they do so while over their Soft Cap, they instead take SPA damage per point over the cap.
