The action of Destruction is frequently avoided by mages, as the very magics they use to control and direct the destructive energies are themselves vulnerable to destruction, as are the mages themselves. Contrary to common beliefs, Destruction is not annihilation, merely unmaking; what is destroyed is rended back to shadowmist, and drifts away across planar boundaries to return to the Shadow Sea if not seized. While it is very difficult to learn safely, it is still very useful, combining with Creation to allow transmutation in places where the Shadow Sea is inaccessible, and as a weapon very few beings know how to defend against adequately.

Virtually all beings except the Free, even immortal Spirits, have an instinctive fear at the use of powerful Destructive magic, a consequence of its fundamental nature. This is represented as a Minor Intimacy of Fear. While the Anima that forms Souls is not composed of matter or shadowmist and cannot be destroyed though these means, the chaotic energies will ravage the orderliness of their mind and thought if exposed too strongly, producing an effect similar to the memory issues of the Free.
