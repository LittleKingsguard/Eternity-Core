# Destroy

*Before all other things, there is only one law so great even the Eternals themselves are bound to it: Just as that which has never been created cannot be destroyed, all that has been made can be unmade.*  
-- Oblivion Records, Scroll XIII

The energies of Destruction do only one thing, which is to unmake was has been created. This they do with a vigorous fervor and a wide and varied appetite that encompasses nigh anything the ambitious caster might wish to destroy and many things they would likely prefer intact, such as their body, the arcane bindings holding their soul together, and the threads of magic intended to direct these energies away from the former two. Needless to say, it is a rare mage who dares wield such energies at all, and rarer still are those who are confident enough to channel them outside of the laboratory. In use, this effect rends apart the bindings of matter and anima at the most fundamental level, returning matter to shadowmist and the complex interconnected webs of Amina that form thought and memory to base emotion and concept. The shadowmist "ashes" quickly drift back into the Shadow Sea, giving the illusion that the target is completely evaporated to nothing. In manifestation, the energies spark like lightning, seemingly simultaneously in both violent red hues and brilliant whites, and sounds like a medley of primal fears, with many mortals describing it as a blend between an angry predator and an electrical storm.

Base Effect:
Use: Attack or similar  
Cost: 1+ Flux, Special  
Timing: Step 1
Range: Short  
Traits: Scaling 2
Benefit:  
The roll is Upgraded, but follows the below constraint:
On Step 1, the player declares target numbers for Successes, Power, and Tier. When rolling on step 7-10, the player takes the lower of these numbers or the rolled totals, before any spending or accounting for Difficulty/Resistance. If the roll has lower Successes, Power, or Tier than the declared totals above, they target themselves with an Attack on step 11, adding the margin of failure to the roll's Power.  
As an Attack, this spell uses the following profile:
Core Trait: Lethal  
Short Range  
Targets: Target  
Traits: Piercing, Arcing, Reaver  

As Spell component:
Destruction does not currently have an respected use as an accessory magical action in spellcasting due to its chaotic nature. While there are niche uses for it as a source of shadowmist for Shadow or Creation spells, doing so uses the destructive energies as the initiating action and main power limiter on the spell and thus those spells are properly consider to be Destruction spells with other actions as derivative effects.
