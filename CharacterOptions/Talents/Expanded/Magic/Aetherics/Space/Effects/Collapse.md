# Collapse

*Proponents of the matter-relative theory of space claim that distance and volume are made 'real' by the mass contained within. This is obvious nonsense, and if you wish for proof try asking them why the air does not object to the contraction of the space containing it.*  
-- High Scholar Lutheis, remarks made during a reception

Collapsing space takes a distance of empty (or soon to be empty) space and temporarily crushes it down to nothing. This creates a "window" through which things are closer in all practical terms. While from the front-on perspective this window is very apparent, from the sides this is a less obvious change, mostly made apparent by the sounds of the displaced air and a manifestation that to most observers resembles a tunnel of mist.

Base Effect:  
Use: Miscellaneous or Move  
Cost: 2+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Short  
Traits: Sustained, Range Scaling, Line of Effect  
Benefit:  
A bridge of folded space crosses up to one Zone per 2 Flux spent, making a new Zone adjacent to the caster's current one. The caster may choose to step through the bridge and move into the new Zone as part of the Action. 

As Spell component:

## Shorten
Use: Turning an engagement-range effect into a ranged one, or reducing the distance penalties on a Short Range effect
Cost: 2 Flux per Zone of distance
Benefit: The spell collapses space momentarily just before firing, shortening the range to target and making it easier to aim. Ignore 1 Zone of distance for each 2 Flux spent on this effect. If this would reduce the number of Zones to 0, the target may be treated as Engaged.
