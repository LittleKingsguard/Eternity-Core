# Expand

*Those who speak for the Qualia Theory of space claim space exists regardless of what it contains, and that the workings of the Aetheric practices manipulate some unknown quality inherent to space itself. I've yet to hear a good reason why we must invent new fields of physics for this when we have yet to fully comprehend our existing ones.*

Exactly opposite to collapsing space, Expansion manifests more distance from nothing, forming a passage that's longer than there would oherwise be room for. While from the front-on perspective this window is very apparent, from the sides this is a less obvious change, mostly made apparent by the sounds of the displaced air and a manifestation that to most observers resembles a misted portal.

## Avoid
