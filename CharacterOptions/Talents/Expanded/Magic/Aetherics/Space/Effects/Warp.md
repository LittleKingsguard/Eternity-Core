# Warp

*Those of particularly expanded senses may note that beyond the aforementioned "line of sight" directions of up/down, left/right, and forward/backward, there are additional directions that seem to extend out into nothingness. In this direction is the Shadow Sea, and it is perfectly normal. Physical things cannot move in this direction, only space itself can, and thus this is outside of the purview of this chapter.*

"Warping" is the action of manipulating the fabric of space to alter lines of travel, making things briefly appear where they are not, turning straight shots into curved arcs, and vice versa. Like all effects of space manipulation this is a temporary affiar, as once the Aether stops flowing the world will shortly pull itself back flat under its own tension. Also like other forms of space manipulation, both the initial twisting and the rebound afterwards can be very destrcutive to anything too firmly bolted down to adjust to the curvature. A warping effect is usually very apparent due to the curving of light through it, and the rush of displaced air, both of which are frequently magnified by the manifestations that accompany the change.

Base Effect:

## Straighten
Use: Miscellaneous or Overcome  
Cost: 2+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Short  
Traits: Sustained, Range Scaling  
Benefit:  
A pathway is formed through space that produces a straight line where originally none could be drawn, allowing lines of sight and effect to go around corners and over walls. The player must still have a clear path. As part of this action the player may choose to attempt to destroy an Obstacle that is in the path. If the Overcome attempt fails, the remainder of the action also fails.

## Deflect
Use: Parry/Guard  
Cost: 2+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Range: Short  
Traits: Scaling 2, Sustained (Guard only)  
Benefit:  
The mage warps space to deny adversaries a clear line for attack or movement. This may be used to interfere with opponent's actions that require direct line-of-effect or sight, or preventing their motion. Sufficient momentum will overtax the spell's ability to deflect, however. If a Parried Action succeeds, any sustained Guard ends.  

As Spell component:

## Redirect
Use: When other effects require line-of-sight
Cost: 2 Flux per Zone of distance
Benefit: The spell includes a straightening effect as part of its csating, allowing effects to come at off-angles from the caster. Force and projectile effects can bend around corners, Surprising targets that cannot see the origin.
