As limited and blunt as the Action of Creation can be as a tool, on any world on which it is learned it inevitably becomes as world-changing a discovery as magic itself. The requirement that the Aethericist knows *exactly* what they are trying to do is at ts most limiting with the use of this Action, as only quite scholarly traditions have the knowledge base and thorough study to truly understand the matter they intend to conjure at its most fundamental and indivisible level. Even then, only those approaching the pinnacles of knowledge can form more than pure base elements and simple alloys. That this would include iron and steel is already destructive enough to an unprepared economy; that *gold* likewise can be manifested from shadows by the ton goes a long way towards explaining why planar metropoles invariably avoid coinage in their currencies.

All Creation effects are Exclusive and spells using them can only be cast by those who have the appropriate Talents for them.
