# Metallugical Studies

*Pure iron is a capable material for many applications, but it lacks in strength and hardness in comparison to even simple carbon steels. Alloys with more exotic elements such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, tungsten, etc. may in turn far surpass such basics with appropriate heat treatments.*

Forming alloys is a step more sophisticated than simple elemental metals, but pays great dividends in terms of the strength and utility of the conjured products. A conjurer skilled in metallurgy can custom-fit metal alloys to suit the needs of a particular use case, and with appropriate care can turn Energy manipulation to the ends of perfecting the annealing and temper of their craft.

## As Component
Use: Any spell that conjures metals  
Cost: 1 Flux  
Traits: --  
Benefit: The base metals are substituted for stronger alloys. The Scaling Trait of the spell increases by 1. If the spell includes a Heat effect, this is increased again.
