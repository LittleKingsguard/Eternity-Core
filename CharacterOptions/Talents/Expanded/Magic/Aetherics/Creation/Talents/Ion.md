# Ion Conjuration

*Warning: Static electricity will not remain static, and is faster than you.*

Static electricity is a frequent side effect of novice conjuration attempts, but creating it on purpose is a much harder and more dangerous task, as the tremendous power generated defies most means of control available to Aetheric means.

## Base effect

## Spark
Use: Attack Action  
Cost: 1+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Engaged  
Target: Burst  
Traits: Scaling 2  
Benefit:  
The nearest object or character to the source treats the Action as Upgraded again, unless it is resistant to electricity. This may include the caster themselves, if they are not protected by a resistant barrier (simple Force effects do not count). The burst spreads from wherever the jolt arcs to ground, and affects all creatures touching the ground or a conductive grounded surface within the area, potentially including the caster. The blast uses the following profile:
Core Trait: Swift/Lethal  
Blast  
Traits: Arcing, Shock

## Electrify
Use: Attack Action  
Cost: 1+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Engaged  
Target: Weapon Attack  
Traits: Scaling 2  
Benefit:  
A flash of electricity is sent through a metal (or similarly conductive) weapon or other tool the caster is wielding, causing sparks to arc off and jump to the target of the attack. The attack gains the Arcing and Shock traits, but neither trait may result in more Power being added than was generated by spending FLux.

## As Component
Use: Attack with conjured weapon
Cost: 1+ Flux
Benefit: The Attack gains the bonus of Electrify, above.
