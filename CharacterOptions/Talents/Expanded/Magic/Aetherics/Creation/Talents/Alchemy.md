# Alchemical Studies

*Combustion within a pure oxygen atmosphere, while dangerous, is a very reliable alchemical process that can form a number of useful compounds, listed here with their original second reagents: Water (hydrogen), quicklime (Calcium), glassmaker's flux (boron), glass (silicon), corundum (aluminum), magnesia (magnesium), white pigment (titanium)[...].*

Directly conjuring matter in compound states is exponentially more complex than the bare elemental forms that even novices can manage, to the point where even masters can rarely manage such simple compounds as water. What is far easier for creating a surprising variety of useful compounds is to simply conjure the base elements required and let the processes of Physical alchemy take their natural course from there.Unfortunately this is nowhere nearly as clean of a technique, as entropy offers very few gentle slopes from the reactive potential of raw elements to their stable compound forms, and the steeper cliffs manifest in explosions and fire.

## Base effect
Use: Acquire Action, or Progress on a related Project  
Cost: 2 Flux  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Self  
Target: Object  
Traits: --  
Benefit:  
The spell forms matter in precise ratios, allowing them to react to form new substances. The mage may conjure more crafting materials than just base metals, though the power and potential violence of the reaction require great care or a significant amount of auxillary magic to contain. The Spillover of the Action is upgraded by a Tier.  
If the spell includes Heat manipulation as a component effect, the spell gains Scaling.

## As Component
Use: Fire spell  
Cost: 1 Flux  
Traits: --  
Benefit: Tweaks to the magic ensure the spell burns cleaner and more fully. The Scaling Trait of the spell increases by 1.
