# Flame Conjuration

*Collateral can always make new enemies faster than damage can remove the original ones.*  
-- 88 Axioms for the Adventurous Aetherborn, #44

In its simplest practice, Flame Conjuration is merely conjuring any element the mage knows of that happens to be flammable (which is most of them, when properly prepared), and then adding enough heat to ignite it. In practice, the element of choice is usually hydrogen, which is conveniently gaseous, extremely light, very simple, ignites very easily, and burns white-hot. These properties make it quite reliable and efficient as a conjured fuel, and Flame Conjurers are notorious for their destructive power, comprising the living artillery and trench-clearing muscle of many armies across the Physical Realms. They are *also* the most notorious examples of the lack of precision Aetheric spells are frequently constrained by; a mage may end up spent as much or more Aether on protecting themselves from their own flames as they do on the flames themselves.

## Base effect
Use: Conflict Action  
Cost: 1+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Self  
Target: Blast  
Traits: Scaling 2, Overt  
Benefit:  
The spell conjures a cloud of flammable gas, igniting it with a spark of Energy (included in cost), producing a blast of tremendous heat and power. This creates a Blast effect centered on *and affecting* the caster, using the following profile:
Core Trait: Lethal  
Blast  
Traits: Wash

## As Component
Use: When conjuring a hollow object  
Cost: 1+ Flux  
Traits: Scaling 2  
Benefit: When the object is broken or (if it is Shadowcrafted) dissolves away, a puff of gas is released. If there is any source of fire or heat nearby, such as a Hazard, the cloud ignites, adding additional Power to any Attack or similar destructive Action equal to twice the Flux spent.
