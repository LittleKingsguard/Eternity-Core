# Halogen Conjuration

*WARNING: Without the aid of Animist healing techniques, the recommendation of most healers on treating flourine inhalation is a fatal dose of a faster and less painful poison.*
-- The 83 Pillars of Matter, #9: Fluorine

Outside of the dangerous and foolhardy practise of attempting to conjure elements that don't exist in any known form, no task of Creation is taken more seriously than the use of the Alchemist's Scourge, the halogen elements. This family of elements is so viciously reactive as to burn nearly everything short of the ashes of other, even more reactive siblings. Additionally complicating the issues of containment is that they are all either gases or will become so mere instants after encountering any of the many things with which they react explosively. In appearance, these are cloudy vapors of varying color, from pale yellow or green to a deep red or purple.

## Base effect
Use: Attack or other destructive Action  
Cost: 1+ Flux, Special  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Self  
Target: Blast  
Traits: Scaling  
Benefit:  
The roll is Upgraded, but follows the below constraint:
On Step 1, the player declares target numbers for Successes, Power, and Tier. When rolling on step 7-10, the player takes the lower of these numbers or the rolled totals, before any spending or accounting for Difficulty/Resistance. If the roll has lower Successes, Power, or Tier than the declared totals above, they include themselves in the blast's area, even if they would normally be excluded. The blast uses the following profile:  
Core Trait: Lethal  
Traits: Wash, Persistent  

Additionally, a cloud remains in affected Zones, turing them into Hazardous Terrain and having similar effects on nearby fire-based crises and hazards as [Oxygen](Oxygen.md). Most planes with an established study of Aetherics consider use of this effect to be an Offense.

## As Component
Use: Fire spell  
Cost: Flux equal to base effect  
Traits: Persistent  
Benefit: As Oxygen, but the smoke from the fire is toxic and corrosive, creating Hazardous Terrain in the targeted space.
