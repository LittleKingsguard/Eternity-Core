# Metal Conjuration

*Consider the Principle of Balance: To conjure gold for oneself is to conjure only a yellow rock.*  
-- The Invisible Fist of Command, Book I: Foundations

Perhaps the most notorious means by which Aethericists tend to warp their local society around their own practice, the conjuration of pure base metals is surprisingly easy for most Aethericists. Many academies even traditionally use gold as the starting point of a conjurer's education, as its density, softness, and strong resistance to alchemical methods make it easy to verify the student's work. A competent conjurer can make tons per day of such base metals, and most societies where the practise has an established presence have largely done away with traditional mining and smelting for the acquisition of metals, reserving the methods for gems and decorative stones that are not so easily duplicated.

## Base effect

## Freeform
Use: Acquire Action  
Cost: 2+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Self  
Target: Self  
Traits: Scaling  
Benefit:  
The mage draws mist from the Shadow Sea and weaves it with Aether and heat to bind it into a permanent solid form of metal, creating Gear or a similar Asset.

## Targeted
Use: Acquire/Obstruct Action  
Cost: Flux equal to double the minimum cost of target object  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Engaged  
Target: Shadowsteel Object  
Traits: --  
Benefit:  
The mage takes a Shadowsteel object and instills it with permanence, turning it to a base metal form. While this allows it to continue without the mage's focus, the fully-real object is more limited in capability. The object loses the benefit of any Shadow Talents applied, the final result of the Acquire Action takes the lesser of the original value or the new value, and the Spell is *not* Scaling. The required Tier for the Acquire Action is reduced to the Tier of the object itself.

## As Component
Use: Blast effect
Cost: 2+ Flux
Benefit: The Blast gains Lethal as an additional Core Trait option, or Piercing if it is already Lethal. Additionally, if the spell involves extreme heat or cold, it gains Persistent.
