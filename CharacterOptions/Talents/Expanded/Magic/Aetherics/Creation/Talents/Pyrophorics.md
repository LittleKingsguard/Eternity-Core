# Pyrophorics

*The council acknowledges the utility of phosphorus as a ignition source, but in an effort to address the humanitarian and collateral damage concerns with its use as a primary incendiary and the toxic byproducts thereof, the following restrictions will be instated upon all spells created wih the assistance of or proofread by a Guild mage, or using Guild grounds for testing, under penalty of a lifetime ban if not corrected:*
* *Particle Size may not exceed a Class C powder.*
* *Total mass may not exceed 1/120th of all combustible agents, or 1/60th mol, whichever is greater.*
* *Particles will not be directly acted upon by telekinetic force or otherwise used as a direct projectile.*  
*Addendum: Further revisions included in Appendix C*

A number of elements are known to ignite spontaneously in air when conjured in the right manner, including extremely fine powders of iron, aluminum, magnesium, and other traditionally structural metals. Indeed, this is the exact property used by that most mundane of firestarting methods, flint and steel. While there are mages who prefer the method, such a "dust cloud" can be surprisingly difficult to reliably conjure, and frequently mages in need of a solution to the problem of "automatic ignition" find adding a new element to their repetoire faster and more useful: Phosphorus. This waxy solid ignites in air even in large chunks, and burns into a distinctive thick white smoke that is dangerous when inhaled by most things that breathe at all.

## Base effect
Use: Attack or other destructive Action  
Cost: 1+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Self  
Target: Object  
Traits: Scaling  
Benefit:  
An object is conjured and (unless protected from a breathable atmosphere) immediately bursts into flame, acting as a Hazard due to the heat and toxic smoke. If Object is used to create a fire-based Crisis, the Crisis cannot be ended except by completion or by removing the object. If it is used as part of an Attack, the Attack gains the following traits, if it doesn't have them already:  
Core Trait: Lethal  
Traits: Persistent  

Most planes with an established study of Aetherics consider use of this effect to be an Offense.

## As Component
Use: Fire spell  
Cost: --  
Traits: --  
Benefit: A spell may always be treated as having an ignition source or nearby flame, if relevant.
