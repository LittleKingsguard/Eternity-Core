# Oxygen Conjuration

*These halls are a temple of Physics, not metaphysics. Fire is an alchemical process to which mystics ascribe primal meaning, and that is how it is taught here. If those mystics would like to challenge this definition, they are free to come to the test range and compare truths by crater size.*  
-- Headmaster Kallotas, Red Desert Academy, closing remarks during failed cultural exchange

Oxygen is a component of the air necessary for powering both breathing flesh and blood and roaring flames, and canny Aethericists use it for both purposes. The presence of oxygen makes living creatures breathe easier and helps them push harder, while it makes exposed flames burn hotter, bigger, and brighter. The gas itself, however, is invisible outside of the normal manifestations of Creation.

## Base effect
Use: Miscellaneous Action  
Cost: 2+ Flux  
Timing: Step 1  
Range: Self  
Target: Blast  
Traits: Area Scaling, Subtle  
Benefit:  
The spell exudes a cloud of gas nearly indistinguishable from air, save for its effects on any surrounding flames. Any fire-based Crises in any affected Zones immediately advance once, consuming this effect for that Zone in the process. For the remainder of the Scene, the following effects apply:
* Fire-based Hazards are Upgraded in effect
* Any time a character expends Effort while using their Physical Ability, they gain an additional +1 Floating Bonus
* Any fire-based attacks are Upgraded

Any fire-based Action that affects target + Engaged or any larger area ends the effect for the Zone.

## As Component
