# Heat

*Heat is dismissed by some engineers as wastage, some new and useless form of energy that their kinetic motion becomes through inefficiency. In truth, it is simply kinetic energy on too small of a scale to wield in isolation. By understanding this, one may begin to conceive of ways to harness it in the aggregate.*  
-- Lessions on Artifice, Chapter IV: On Heat

Heat magic deals in the transformation of Aether to heat, and in using the structures of aether formed by the spell as conduits to accelerate the natural flows of heat. Notably missing is any ability to *remove* heat; the Phyiscal laws of entropy are among the more difficult ones to subvert, though clever mages find tricks by way of conjuration. Most dangerously, compared to other, more efficient means of generating heat, the magic ignores purely physical barriers, letting targets be cooked from the inside out. Manifestations depend on the viewer's associations of temperature, but most see the use as a dull red incandesence in any affected objects heating up, and frost forming on cooling ones, regardless of whether the temperatures achieved would actually preduce either effect.

Base Effects:

## Induction
Use: Action  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1
Range: Short
Targets: Any 1  
Traits: --
Benefit:  
The mage flashes Aether directly into heat in the target, melting ice, setting fires, burning obstacles and opponents, etc.  

When used for an Attack, this uses the following profile:
Core Trait: Lethal  
Short Range  
Targets: Target  
Traits: Piercing  

## Transfer
Use: Action, or Oppose/Assist Reaction  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1/2
Range: Short
Targets: Target, Target+Engaged, or Zone  
Benefit:  
The spell bridges the target to a heat sink or heat source, quickly equalizing the two in temperature. When used as an Attack or similar Action, this must use a terrain feature of notably extreme temperature such as a fire hazard or a zone of ice, and uses the Hazard/Obstacle/Difficult Terrain as a Defined-Capability Gear bonus. As a Reaction, this can target heat-based Actions such as fire attacks.

When used for an Attack, this uses the following profile:
Core Trait: Lethal  
Short Range  
Targets: Target, Target+Engaged, or Zone  
Traits: Piercing  

As Spell component:
Prerequisite: Another effect of the spell involves extreme heat or cold
Cost: Half of total Power
Benefit: The improved heat conduction upgrades the spell's Tier, and gives it Piercing if used as a weapon.
