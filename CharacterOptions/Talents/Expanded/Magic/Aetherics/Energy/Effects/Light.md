# Light

*Light is energy in the ultimate state of motion.*

Light magic transforms the energies from the Aether into a light source, projecting it from the spell's origin in a direction of the mage's choice. Most Aethericists treat it as a general utility spell for illuminating dark places, but the option of tight, flickering directional beams makes it equally useful for long-distance signalling, or flash-blinding enemies. In most cases, the manifestations of Light are indistinguishable from the effects, though exotic uses (ex. light outside the visible spectrum, through totally opaque smoke) may still produce an illusory glow for viewers who shouldn't be able to see the created light.

Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1
Range: Long

## Signal
Use: Miscellaneous Action, or Support  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1
Range: Overwatch
Targets: Any character whose location is known, or all characters in target Zones  
Benefit:  
A staccato flicker of light communicates a message to the targets using prearranged signs, coding the message into color and flash patterns, or similar means.

## Flashblind
Use: Attack Dilemma  
Cost: --  
Timing: Step 1
Range: Long
Targets: Target character with sight  
Traits: Overt, Hypervelocity
Benefit:  
A tight beam of light is aimed at the target's eyes, overpowering their vision and forcing them to avert their gaze or be blinded. All damage is associated with a Dilemma vs. Blinded, and the Attack is upgraded.

As Spell component:
Cost: 1+ Power, Overt
Benefit: Just prior to fully commiting the spell, a simple light effect illuminates the target. At 1 Power, this removes any Concealment from darkness. Any additional power adds the following Dilemma vs. targets that can see the spell being cast:

Timing: Step 2  
Strength: additional Power  
Consequence: Target is Off-Guard to the Spell's effect. Only DT applies as a defense to this Dilemma.
