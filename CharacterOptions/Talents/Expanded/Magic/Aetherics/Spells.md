While the simplicity of the fundamental actions means every Aethericist has at least some limited knowledge and experience with all eight, the complexity of using them in practice means it is difficult and likely dangerous to "improvise" a use for ones outside the mage's area of expertise. The traditional way of circumventing this issue is through Spells.

Spells are treated as a specialty Gear Asset for use with Aetheric Actions. They are always Defined Cabability, however there are consequences for using a Spell of greater capability than the caster is capable of on their own. If the mage tries to cast a Spell with a higher Dice or Power rating than their Aether Ability, they take APA damage for each point in difference. If the Spell is a higher Tier than the character can achieve without the bonus for the Spell, the damage is raised one track for each Tier in difference, and cannot be below 1.

A Spell can take any forms, depending on the Font of Magic chosen by the mage, the magical tradition they are part of, and their own personal preferences. At their core, however, each spell is simply math and instructions; they have no power without the mage to channel it, and they impart no guidance or ability to a mage who is not intimately familiar with the spell's method of representing that core meaning. Because of this, many Aethericists prefer to write their own spells so they can be certain of how they work. In places with a formal academic tradition and a firmly-defined "language" for magic, it does become more common to trade in spells professionally, though, as mages have more confidence in the system and libraries than their own work.
