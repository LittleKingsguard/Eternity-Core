All attempts using a Magic Ability must use at least one Font of Magic for each such Ability used. Most Fonts are specific to a single Ability.

The Font chosen defines the character's approach to magic and how they are channeling it, and usually grants bonuses depending on what they are trying to accomplish and their current state.
