"Magic" as a term refers to the actions and arts that can only be performed through the interplay of the Aetheric and Physical Realms, the energies filling both, and the associated natural laws that govern each. Magic is capable of great wonders not possible through Physical means alone, but subject to constraints that neither mortal nor Spirit entirely comprehend, and even the greatest such beings cannot truly claim to have transcended any need for mundane means. Any being possessed of a Soul can use magic, though most mortals only do so unconsciously, and primarily to resist other magics (ex. through [Survival Instincts](../../../Soul/Universal/Mortals/Common/Traits/SurvivalInstincts.md)).

# Manifestations
Uses of magic or naturally-occurring examples of wild magic typically have Manifestations, hallucinatory sensations created by the subconscious mind attempting to translate the perception it has of the Aether into something the conscious mind can comprehend. Manifestations are purely illusory and usually harmless, though they can be quite unpleasant, and inexperienced characters or unaware bystanders may not understand their illusory nature and make dangerous decisions out of ignorance. This can be a valid application of Spillover, in the relatively frequent case where a magical Action is high-tier enough to inflict any. The manifestations from a tradition are in effect any time they are invoking the Ability or if they have nonzero Passion.
