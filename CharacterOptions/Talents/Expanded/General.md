Expanded Abilities represent effects of the characterâ€™s status in society, or supernatural gifts that are not directly tied to their mental, social, or physical competence.

A character requires a Major Talent as an initiation prerequisite before they may raise their Ability ratings above 0/0. The player may choose to increase (or start with) Ratings or learn Minor Talents while the Major Talent is being Trained, however.

An Expanded Ability can only be used for a roll for a small subset of actions by default, and Talents may unlock additional ones. If an attempt is not focused on one of the default use cases, and the character cannot invoke a relevant Talent within that Ability, they cannot use the Ability for the attempt even as a Secondary. Conversely for this limited utility, Expanded Abilities are powerful in their niche, and easier to advance vertically in strength than the Core Abilities.
