Expanded Abilities relating to Status represent the character's position in the world, their resources, reputation, and other things that are not entirely within their control, and thus potential means of affecting the character without direct interaction. A Wealthy character may be harmed by the theft or destruction of their fortune, a well-connected puppetmaster may be rendered powerless by their reputation falling apart, or an agent of a powerful organization may lose their narrative relevance because their masters have lost patience with them and rescinded their authority.

While the narrative assumption is that the character is diversified enough that they are unlikely to lose everything to a single attack, this does provide a means of harassing the character. A character that has discovered one of the Talents for the Ability can find or introduce a Location or Side Character related to the Talent as part of Scene Initiation, which can be targeted by Conflict Goals for the Scene.

However, in accordance with the societal scales of power these Abilities represent, they are rarely soft targets. The targeted character can always Join the Scene by proxy, spending Agency/Impact to introduce guards, obsacles, and other challenges opposing the Conflict Goals. This can be done passively for no Spotlight cost, or actively, if the character joins in person or wishes to spend Resources. Finally, the charact'er Defense Tier is raised by 1 against such threats.
