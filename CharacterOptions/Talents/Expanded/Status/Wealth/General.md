While any character may be well-off as represented by Lifestyle or Capital Assets, a character with Wealth has the same perks but far more stably. Assets come and go, but a Wealthy character is always defined by being spectacularly liquid in comparison to others.

# Uses
Unlike most other Ascended Abilities, the options available to a Wealthy character are largely independent from the Major Talents that unlock the Ability. Money is money, after all, and most people don’t make much distinction between the money of a merchant prince and that of an aristocratic patriarch. Instead, those Talents define the source of the character’s Wealth, and, by extension, what particular uses they are especially good at and what new vulnerabilities they have are.

Wealth in general can be used for most purposes for which a Capital or Lifestyle Asset could be applied, such as acquiring Assets, training, or assisting Recovery. On a more interpersonal level, bribery can be an extremely effective form of Influence.

# Vulnerabilities
The vulnerabilities of a Wealthy character typically constitute things that would be Capital or Lifestyle Assets for another character, such as opulent estates, factories, trade ships, banks, or treasury vaults. They are usually most directly vulnerable to direct theft or destruction, though depending on the local politics and culture, it may be possible to deprive them through more social- or intrigue-based means, such as invoking the wrath or greed of a Power, or conning them out of their fortune.
