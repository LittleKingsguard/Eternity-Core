# Tycoon

*When one thinks of oppression, they often think of tyrants and dictators. In truth, few governments have the might to enforce their will beyond the bounds of their own planes. The chains that bind the Great Cosmos are not wrought of sword-steel, but ink and paper: the weapons of those who twist property rights to claim they should profit from the labors of another.*
