# Kingpin

*Death and taxes are considered the two constants of mortal life. Aetherborn society demonstrates this is narrow-minded. It's really crime and taxes.*  
-- Mycroft, Soul of Pursuit

The character is (or perhaps was) a successful smuggler, racketeer, blackmailer, inside trader, or otherwise a professional criminal at the head of a ring of like-minded crooks.

Cost: 1 Resources  
Timing: Step 1/2  
Benefit:  
The character upgrades the current Attempt. The character’s Wealth Talents and any Assets acquired using them are always Confidential, even if they would normally be Public. However, the character is always guilty of at least one Offense, and even if they successfully bury an Investigation, the investigating character may simply start over. This Offense is a special vulnerability of the Expanded Ability, and is subject to the same protections.

Describe the nature of the character’s criminal history when taking this Talent. When using Wealth for an Action relevant to this history (ex. An arms dealer acquiring a new Weapon Asset), they may waive the normal RS cost. Doing so makes owning the Asset an Offense, however.
