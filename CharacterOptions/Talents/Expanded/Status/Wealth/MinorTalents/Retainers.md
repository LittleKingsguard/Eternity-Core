--88 Axioms for the Adventurous Aetherborn

Use: During Scene Initiation  
Cost: +1 R
Benefit:  
The player can introduce a new Minion or Troop into the Scene, either in addition to Initiating or Joining the Scene normally or as a proxy for the character. The Minion is of the same Tier as the character's Devense Tier, and has a base Dice/Power equal to the character's Wealth Ratings, which can be increased by a total of 2 for each additional Resources spent.

If the Minion/Troop is defeated during the Scene, the character takes SPA damage equal to the Resources expended.
