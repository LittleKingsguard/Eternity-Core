# Deceptive Skill

*When attempting to produce explosives by the means of Spirit Alchemy, a base of congealed rage is favored as a cheap, functional medium. Not only does it readily absorb other, more directly destrutive Animas, but its inherent volatility can contribute to the final blast if appropriately primed.*  
--Alchemy for the Anarchist, Book 2: Animist Practices

Use:  Inducing a target to Attack or otherwise take hostile action against the character or a third party.  
Cost: 1 Effort  
Benefit:  
 If the target declines to follow the Influence and instead takes the damage, the Dilemma is modified. If on a subsequent Influence towards the same Action they give in, they also take a 1-Success penalty on that Attack(s), but gain +1 Power. This is cumulative if multiple Influences are used.
