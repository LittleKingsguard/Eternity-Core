Use: After [prerequisite action state, ex. Successful Attack, target accepts Dilemma]  
Cost: 1 AP  
Timing: Step 12  
[Fluff explanation] [Mechanical impact]  

Design Notes:  
Follow-up is intended for effects that act as a continuation of the previous action, such as a second strike in a combo or a pursuit following a successful knockback attempt. These are optional talents that the player may choose to invoke after they already know the triggering Action is successful, and have very limited counterplay options. They should never do straight damage outside of a Dilemma, as they bypass Protection due to a previous Reaction or Protection already being applied. The AP cost is meant to represent both it being an after-the-fact continuation of the Action, similar to a Reaction, as well as a balancing factor on what is intended to be a powerful effect, similar to taking a complete Action, though with limited use cases.
