Design Notes:  
Contest-dependent Followup is meant to evoke a strategy that requires a specific response to neutralize its effectiveness, such as a Social Control needing to be refuted on its own terms. These are intended to allow the player to target weak abilities in Advesaries or easily overcome Minions, or severely hinder their rolls by forcing them to pay to overcome the character's advantage.
