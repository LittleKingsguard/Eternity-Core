Use: <Oppose/Parry vs. Conflict type>  
Cost: 1+/1+ Dice/Power  
Timing:  
* Declare Step 2
* Resolve Step 11  
[Fluff explanation] <Mechanical impact -- typically, returns a similar Conflict attempt as the trigger, using the spent Power+Dice as the total Power. The Attacker may reduce this by spending Dice/Power or negate it by spending a Tier or succeeding the Action with equal or greater total Power.>  

Design Notes:  
A Wager Retaliation is for handling applications of the phrase "the best defense is a good offense", ex. forcing an enemy to abort an Attack to avoid a powerful swing. The minimum cost is to mandate that it actually has Power on the counterattack, and the ability to negate it entirely is to de-optimize the strategy of simply dumping all of their dice/power on the Talent.
