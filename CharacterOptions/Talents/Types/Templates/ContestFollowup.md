[Fluff explanation] [Mechanical impact: Action that takes place if the character wins the specified Contest. Power of event is the lesser of the Action's remaining Power or the margin of victory in the Contest.]  

Design Notes:  
Contest-dependent Followup is meant to evoke a strategy that has additional effects against certain means of defense, such as broad sweeping attacks that force an opponent not relying on physical agility or strength to move off their spot. These are intended to allow the player to target weak abilities in Advesaries or easily overcome Minions, or severely hinder their rolls by forcing them to pay to overcome the character's advantage.

If the character faces a penalty for failing the Contest, this has no activation cost. Otherwise, there is either an Effort cost, or a minimum amount of Dice or Power must be added to the Contest.
