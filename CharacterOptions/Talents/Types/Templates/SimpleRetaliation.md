[Fluff explanation] <Mechanical impact -- typically, returns a similar Conflict attempt as the trigger, using the defender's margin of victory in the Power Comparison as the total Power.>  

Design Notes:  
A Simple Retaliation is for handling ripostes, social comebacks, etc. in which the defender requires an overwhelming victory to deal significant damage. The Effort cost is to provide a limit on the total number of uses per turn even with Guard Actions, and to provide a opportunity cost, though not as steep of one as Follow-Ups, as unlike a Follow-Up it is possible for an Simple Retaliation to fail.
