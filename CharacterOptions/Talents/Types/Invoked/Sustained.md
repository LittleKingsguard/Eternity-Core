A Sustained Talent is a Simple or Scaled Talent that has a continuing effect. A Sustained Talentâ€™s effect continues until the character ends it as part of an Action or Reaction, which may be done freely, or another character successfully Counters it. The character must also pay any cost to invoke the Talent at the start of every subsequent round or its effects end, though this may be done reflexively.
