*'To decide where you stand is to seize opportunity from your opponents and claim it as your own.' If one follows this notion to it's conclusion, a curious paradox is found: The best place to make one's stand is always somewhere else.*  
--Meditations on Distance, Chapter VI opening line

Use: When taking a Move Action or overcoming an Obstacle or Hazard
Cost: 1 AP  
Benefit:  
If the character moves within their own Zone as part of an Action, the movement is not interrupted by a successful Oppose unless the character fails to meet the required Tier to overcome it.

If the character moves between Zones, they may attack a valid target from their new position as part of the Action, using the same roll. If the target did not attempt to engage them during their movement, they may attempt to Oppose or Parry this attack. If they did Oppose the movement, they may Oppose or Parry the attack at no extra cost, and they retain any bonuses from their original reaction.

Design Note: 

Because the attack uses the same roll as the Move, Flying Step would upgrade the Attackâ€™s tier as well.
