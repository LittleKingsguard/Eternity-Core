# Pack Rat

*Nice enough guy, but he looked kooky enough that learn to walk into the bar separately if you wanted any luck. Then one day we were exploring some forgotten temple on an Ashen World, and it turns out what you get when a cat god gets forgotten is a Prowler. In the middle of us running for our lives, he pulls out a brass flask, pops the cork, and hurls it down the other side of a junction. This oversize saber-toothed housecat instantly goes from trying to kill us to trying to huff the smoke from this thing and we get away. Turns  out it was a cat treat he bought at a Shadow Sea waystation two years earlier. Never said anything about how many pockets he had again.*
