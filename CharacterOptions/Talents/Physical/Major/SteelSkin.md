# Mastery of the Steel Skin

*For most people, armor is the last line of defense. But if one has learned to trust it, it can also serve as the first one.*

Benefit: 

When the character uses armor to Parry an Attack or similar Hazard, they upgrade the Tier after all other bonuses are applied.

When using the Distraction Support option, the character only takes the consequences of Going Hot on every second use.
