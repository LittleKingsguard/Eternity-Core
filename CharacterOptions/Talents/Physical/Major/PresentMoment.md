# Mastery of the Present Moment

*Do not seek to outpace your enemy, you will only put him on the defensive. Rather, ready yourself to stike between the beats of his motion.*  
-- Honor Soul Seki

Benefit:  
When the character Parries or Opposes another character's Action and the opponent fails to meet the Tier or fails by more Successes than their own Initiative, the next Action the character takes against them is upgraded after all other bonuses.

The first time during a Scene when the character would take consequences for Going Hot on a violent Support, they ignore the consequences instead.
