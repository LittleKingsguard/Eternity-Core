# Mastery of the Empty Hand

*The unheld sword is no threat, because it is not the sword that kills, but the hand that wields it. This is the first truth that must be embraced by any that seek comprehension of the Destroyer's Art, and not merely the results of its practice.*
-- Oblivion Records, Scroll I

Benefit: 

When the character makes an Attack, Parry, Phyiscal Control/Trap, or similar Physical Action without using any Gear or similar Assets, they upgrade the Tier after all other bonuses are applied. This also applies when attempting to Assist such Actions or Reactions.

The character can also take violent Physical Supports such as Sabotage or Distraction during non-Physical scenes at no additional penalty, due to not needing any suspicious weapons or other equipment.
