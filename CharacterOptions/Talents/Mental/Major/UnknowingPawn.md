Benefit:  
When Scheming, the character upgrades their Progress Action by 1. Alternatively, they may choose to make the Sheme count against the original Project's Redundancy by 1 more than usual, and their Scheme may still succeed if this causes the original Project to collapse.

Characters that benefit from your Supports involving plans or knowledge (ex. Recon, Briefing, Strategize, etc.) ignore the effect of Off-Guard or downgrade Suprised or Unaware for that roll.
