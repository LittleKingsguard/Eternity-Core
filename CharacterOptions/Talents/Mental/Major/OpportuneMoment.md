# Mastery of the Opportune Moment

*There is no great book of Fate in which the aspiring student may scribe their dreams. To impose one's tale upon the Heavenly Order, it must be built, line by line, from words snatched away from Reality at the moment of their truth.*  
-- Destiny Manifesting Law, Third Scroll of the Disciple

Benefit:  
When spending a Tier to increase the Agency or Impact of a Goal during a Scene, the effective change is increased by 1. The character may choose to add this to other character's Goals, to gain their choice of one of the following benefits:
1. The D/R/Tier of the Goal's objective is increased as appropriate for the added Impact or Agency.
2. The added Agency/Impact still belongs to the acting character and will be transferred to a different Goal during resolution if completed
3. Default (value of the Goal increases for the character that introduced it during resolution, D/R/Tier remains unchanged).

Finally, when interacting with other character's Goals, they upgrade any Action for which they spent a [Reserve](../../../../Systems/SceneEngine/Reserves.md).

The character's Supports gain +1 Power for each different Support they have already used during this Scene.
