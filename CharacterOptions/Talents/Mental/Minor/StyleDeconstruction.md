*The diamond chips the hammer that strikes it blindly, but is shattered by the tap that touches its hidden flaws.*  
--Codex of the Eternal Scholar, Book XI

Use: Setting a Trap against a specific character or Troop Attacking the character.  
Cost: 1+ Dice, 1+ Power  
Benefit:  
The Trap remains active for the remainder of the Scene, or until they reveal a combat Talent the character did not know about. The target may ignore the Trap by paying an equal number of dice/power on any Action that would trigger it as they adjust to cover the weakness being exploited.
