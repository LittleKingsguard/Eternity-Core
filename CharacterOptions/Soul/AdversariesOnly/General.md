These Soul Types lack either the higher thought required to act and cooperate as a Player Character should, or do not possess the independent will and capacity for change to be a dynamic character. While they can still be complex individuals capale of reason, negotiation, and desire, their fundamental nature and goals are immutable and unchangeable, at least without becoming a different being entirely first. In some sense they are more akin to forces of nature with personality; while a Chained or an Autarch might be able to rationalize a justification for their driving purpose, they cannot choose to go against it any more than a common fire can choose not to burn.

An entity bearing one of these Souls, in addition to their other Major and Minor Intimacies, has a Defining Purpose.
