Genius Loci embody places, and channel their Shapes: The Mountain, The Forest, The River, The Desert, and so on. The Physical body of a Loci can be as varied as any Spirit short of the most esoteric of the Free. Many pass for a simple feature of the landscape, such as a boulder or tree, an animal native to the land, or even a mortal hermit dwelling within.

A Lociâ€™s Aspect magic is poorly-suited to direct confrontation compared to the destructive power of Elementals or the wild strength of Totems, but their manipulation of the weather, flora, and fauna of their place of power makes them a severe threat to communities encroaching on their territory regardless. Loci are more distrustful of civilization than any other Spirit, and prefer to keep it as far away as possible.
