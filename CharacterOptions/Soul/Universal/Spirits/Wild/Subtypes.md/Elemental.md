Elementa channel the Shapes of the classical elements of magic and nature: The Flame, The Wind, The Wave, and The Stone, as well as many more esoteric or “hybrid” elements. An Elemental’s body is always at least partially wrought from the element it embodies, even if it knows other magics or desires to change its form; a multitalented Flame elemental might be able to craft a suitable vessel of stone, but it will still smolder with flames should it attempt to wear it, and it will still heat any room it cares to stand in.

While often viewed as the most directly powerful and dangerous due to the blunt-force application of their magic, they are also often the most amenable to coexistence with Mortals or other Spirits. Few such communities, after all, have any reason (or meaningful ability to) destroy the ground beneath their feet, or the water off their shores, leaving the Elemental with little inherent reason to be concerned by their spread.
