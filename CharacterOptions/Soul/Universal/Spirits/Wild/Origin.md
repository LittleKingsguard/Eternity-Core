When free-willed souls think about the physical world around them, the cast-off Anima remains close to the Physical realm, and the slow work of Aetheric currents and the numberless ephemeral Free carry it towards the Physical entities represented in those thoughts. As a haze of Anima builds around subjects of so much interest, by way of Attraction it draws forth a tendril of power from a Primal Shape, an idealized conception of the Physical thing formed from all Anima cast into the Aether. This tendril bridges the congealing Anima to the deep Aetheric Sea, causing a sudden flood of energy potent enough to arc across the Aetheric Gap and light the Spark of Will that animates the newborn Wild Soul.

Consequently, the personality, ideals and worldview of a Primal is strongly seeded by what those original thinkers believed about whatever the Wild Soul embodied. A Primal Wolf that stalks the woods outside of a mortal village might be a ruthless monster that must be satiated with sacrificial animals or it will stalk the streets for mortal prey, while another such wolf in a Fae glade could be a noble protector and willing mount.
