Unlike Mortals or even most other Spirits, the Wild have little inherent requirement for action, needing neither food as Mortals do, or the Anima shenanigans of the Free and the Unbound. They do, however, still have the drive to act in accordance with the primal will of their form: Beasts hunt, flames burn, storms blow, and so on. This is further shaped by the ideals and beliefs they are created with, as above, and by those they form for themselves, being free-willed Spirits.

Opinions on Mortals vary wildly between different individuals, varying from “prey” to merely being a nuisance to protective urges to the subject of fascination, and, while the Wild are traditionally associated with nature and wilderness, it is not unheard of for them to actively seek out societies for one reason or another. Integrating into such societies is a different matter altogether, complicated by all manner of incompatibilities and misunderstandings, and it is more common for them to simply adopt what trappings they care for and live far enough apart to ignore the ones they don’t. For example, blacksmithing is an almost stereotypical hobby of Flame Elementals who consider themselves more sophisticated than a sentient wildfire, but they still know better than to ply their trade in a wooden town.
