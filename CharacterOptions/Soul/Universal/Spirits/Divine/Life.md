The Divine Spark itself literally consumes faith the way a fire consumes wood, meaning a bearer whose cult loses faith will see their Spark burn out in concerningly short order. This gives Divinities a consistent day job of maintaining the loyalty of their existing cult, often accompanied by expanding the cult, and scheming to steal worshippers away from other cults. Divinities are perfectly capable of cooperating with each other to form a proper pantheon that allows them to cover each others' areas of weakness, but this just as often adds "office politics" to their list of daily responsibilities.

Divine Cults are substantially larger and higher-maintenance than the comparatively limited networks of Callers and Anima traders that an Unbound would establish, and many Unbound have, at some point in their long lives, taken a stab at Divinity only to decide it required greater attention and time management skills than they cared to express. Such Unbound are often sought after by Divinities as agents, as they are considered less likely to scheme against their employers.
