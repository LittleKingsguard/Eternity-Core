If the Divine's body is destroyed, they may always choose to be restored to form at any active consecrated temple of Tier equal to their own DT between Scenes, even if their original Soul would make their independent return impossible, such as a Mortal or Unbound. If they do not have an appropriate temple, they may be returned by a religious ceremony in the form of an Action or Project of equal Tier. The Divine may direct their Followers, Allies, or Organization to do this, but cannot actively Join the Scene to assist until the ceremony is complete.
