An Unbound can be Called by any other character sufficiently initiated into at least one magical Art, that has a way of identifying them specifically. This requires an Action or Project of equal Tier to the Unbound's Defense Tier. On a failure one Tier lesser, the rite succeeds in Calling a different Spirit, often a younger, weaker, and more impulsive Unbound of the same type. A failure by two or more Tiers simply fails to establish any connection outright.

If the Unbound has previously met the Calling character, or the Caller has an object invested with the Unbound's Anima, they cannot accidentally summon a different Spirit. If the Unbound is already present in the Scene while unincarnated, the required Tier is reduced by 1.

On a successful Calling, the Unbound may incarnate into an available Body Asset present in the Scene and involved in the rite, or may manifest one as part of the Calling, choosing traits as with a Mortal, plus any extras allowed by their Talents.
