Unbound cannot die by any means short of the rarest and most esoteric arts of True Destruction, or the direct will of the Eternal Destroyer.

Should they completely fill their NPA track with damage from any other source that doesn't specify a means of defeat (as does Investigation, for example), such as refused Dilemmas, Exertion, etc., they are instead made Hollow. If they are currently incarnated, they regain 1 NPA at the end of the round. Otherwise, they are Defeated, unless they can burn an Asset to have themselves Called again.
