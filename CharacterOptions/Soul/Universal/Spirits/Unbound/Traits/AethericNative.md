Unbound are native to the Aetheric Sea, and capable of surviving, moving, and even limited action even without any connection to the Physical at all. However, with no connection to the Physical, they have to rely entirely on their stored reserves of magic, and thus take APA damage for each Action taken, and SPA damage taken for each Scene started. They also do not Recover at the end of Rounds or Acts, and Recovery Actions or Scenes automatically fail unless Assisted by a character unhindered by any such limitations. Unbound are not affected by these restrictions while incarnated.

Additionally, Unbound have the ability to communicate in High Celestial regardless of their current status. Doing so while unincarnated costs 1 APA per such statement.
