Because an Unbound's immortality is so close to perfect, there is generally very little that can be done to forcibly remove them from story. If they can be forced to abondon their current incarnation, they can be prevented from taking direct physical action until they are re-Called. This does not stop them from moving around, perceiving things, or conversing in High Celestial, meaning that even if they can no longer make Attacks or similar direct approaches, they are perfectly capable of taking Influence, Discover, Investigate, and Acquire Actions, among others, as well as being affected by most of the same. There are also limits to how long they may continue trying such Actions while disembodied before they turn themselves Hollow, and most Unbound will elect to simply leave and seek out contingencies and allies on other planes rather than risk running themselves dry, particularly in the presence of enemies.

An Unbound will usually accept defeat and depart the story if they find themselves unincarnated at the end of an Act with more more of their NPA track filled than they would Recover at the end of the story. Making them stay (ex. so they can be Hollowed and trapped) requires an NPA-level Control Dilemma.
