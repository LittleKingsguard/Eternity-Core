Unbound are spectacularly powerful compared to mortals or more common spirits, to the point where the consequences of a *single* Unbound incarnating into a world can be used as a benchmark to guage its magical sophistication, hopefully just as a thought experiment. Even in the most magically developed societies replete with great mages and heroes, a mature Unbound is still a force not to be taken lightly. In places where the Aether is a secret of nature, known only in fragments by the Wild and the Free, a tragically common first awakening to the beautiful and terrible power of Anima and Aether in the hands of a skilled and motivated wielder is the first incarnation of a new Unbound.

Each Unbound has an Incarnate Aspect, some particular concept bound in Anima that forms the core of their being, and in all things pertaining to this Aspect their skill is beyond compare. They are likewise excellent Animists, and untold years of combined life experience from the memories incorporated into their creation and their own travels across the cosmos round out into a general degree of skill and talent that varies between near-superhuman and outright superhuman. Finally, they are one of the few varieties of Spirit that regularly practice Fundamentalist magic, often favoring it over Primalism when their native Animism is insufficient. The reasoning is quite simple: The Unbound do not like bindings they cannot break easily, and the connection to the Primal Shape is such a connection.
