Unbound are first created at the sites of great works of of their incarnate aspect. An unfortunately common example is Valkyries forming from the haze of emotion, killing intent, and the memories and knowledge of the fallen after (or in especailly bad cases, during) major battles. Simiarly, Demiurges are known to crystallize into their first incarnation during the construction of great wonders, and tales even tell of single romances whose love was so pure it alone was sufficient to incarnate a Concubus to memorialize it for all time.

This first incarnation is also the only time an Unbound will ever emerge onto the Physical of its own accord, drawn in by the fragments of its congealing Anima stranded on the far side of the Aetheric Gap. At the moment of incarnation, these cross into the Aetheric Sea, and forever after the Physical plane is something they will only ever touch through puppet strings and arcane will. To return to the Physical, an Unbound must be Called (*not* Summoned; an Unbound is not obligated to answer, nor to obey) by a mage or something else capable of channeling enough Aether to open a connection through with the Unbound can manifest a body, or find one to occupy.
