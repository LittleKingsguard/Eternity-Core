Spirits are beings of magical power, natively attuned to the Aethric Plane and awakened to the flow of Anima and Aether. This metaphysical aspect to them makes them distinct from mortals, and, as the distinction might suggest, not intrinsically mortal at all. Most Spirits are at worst inconvenienced by the destruction of their body, and untroubled by age or the concerns of the flesh. This, naturally, makes trying to remove them from a situation they have inserted themselves into much more complicated than it is for mortals, and the means by which this can be done is often dependent on the type of Spirit they are, or even the individual Spirit in question.
