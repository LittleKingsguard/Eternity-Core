Similarly to the limitless range of possibilities the Free may exhibit in personality and shape, they also fill the full range of power. The Ephemeral are indisputably the weakest things to possess the Spark of Will, and some more persistent Sprites are not much stronger. On the far end of the scale, the only reason any Spirit dares argue the Sunless Dreamers are not the most powerful beings short of the Eternal Destroyer is because the Sunless do not care to quiet the boasts of others. Yet.

While the Ephemeral are too short-memory to be meaningful characters, Free Souls as weak as Tier 0 can still have distinct identities, personalities, and months or years of memory. Such relatively tiny Souls still have Animism as an Ability Group, but they do not gain the Tier upgrade from the relevant Major Talent. While such Free are common within their Glades, those found wandering alone are typically more powerful, being at least Tier I.
