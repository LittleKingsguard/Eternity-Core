Changelings are Free Souls that took on mortal guise for one reason or another, and then, still subject to the mutable nature and memory issues common to the Free, got “lost in character” and forgot they weren’t Mortal.

If the future changeling had some foresight, they likely disguised themselves as a mage, allowing them to keep in practice with the Animism they require to maintain themselves without a body. The unfortunately more common case, however, is that they took on the identity of a completely unawakened mortal, and have subsequently forgotten the finer arts of the practice and will be immediately at risk of a schism if they are ever disembodied.

Alternate Traits:
A Changeling starts with a Body of similar traits to any Mortal subtype and may optionally choose to start with a Mortal's starting Ability ratings. 

If they do not possess an Anima rating of at least 1/1, they also gain Survival Instincts, as for a Common Mortal. However, they take Attacks as direct Damage the way Mortals do, as well, and will suffer Defeat by immediate schism if they somehow find themselves without a body.
