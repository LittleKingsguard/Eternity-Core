More powerful than most fairies, the Fae can “bind” to a physical body that itself only exists by their magic, typically wrought from shadowmist, though sand, water, fire, smoke, lava, or other such amorphous forms are possible. The amorphous and wholly controlled nature of their body makes them capable shapeshifters, an ability they have far more than enough life experience to turn towards their own goals, or simply their own entertainment.

Fae are almost definitionally Tier II at minimum, and often stronger, with an arrogance to match. They are usually found in Glades, where they act as the masters and ultimate defenders of the demesne. Even wandering Fae are rarely completely alone, as the memories they discard frequently catch Sparks, leaving trails of Ephemerals in their wake. Should a Fae settle down anywhere the Aetheric wind is relatively calm, these Sparks will eventually develop persistence and form a new Glade.
