Shrouded are terrifyingly powerful Free Souls that have developed the arcane knowledge and sheer brute force to devise an alternate means of restraining their drifting Anima: twisting the fabric of space around themselves, until there exists no direction in which Anima may drift beyond the bounds of their immense Souls. Having transcended the need for a body, most Shrouded find little reason to interact with the rest of the Physical world; as they still possess every last wisp of Anima they have made or consumed over their eons of life, they appear to find their own thoughts and daydreams more fascinating than the banality of the outside world.

Tales abound of powerful spirits and humble mortals alike attempting to gain the attention of a Shrouded One, offering memories of some truly unique experience, refined emotion of some particularly rare and exquisite variety, some other priceless wisp of Anima, or some unique and wonderful treasure, hoping to be rewarded for bringing the light of novelty into the ancient beingâ€™s ennui. Occasionally, they even succeed. Very occasionally, it even ends the way the seeker hoped.

Exactly how strong the Shrouded are is unknown. Even the smallest are somewhere above Tier VI, and when the truly ancient like the Sunless Dreamers stir to action, even gods generally step aside.
