The Anima of the Free Soul straddles the Aetheric Gap, anchoring its Spark on both ends without the need for a body to act as a more persistent anchor, though most Free form one simply for convenience. “Ephemeral” Free form randomly and naturally whenever Anima wisps of like nature drift close enough across the Gap for Attraction to bridge it and form the Spark. However, these tiny souls lack the knowledge of how to stabilize the chaotic energies and usually either lose the Spark or blow away their own Anima after mere seconds.

The typical “persistent” Free Soul is either one of the lucky such sparks that remained whole long enough to learn how to sustain itself, or began as a piece of another, older Free that experienced a schism. Less commonly, the Free are also the easiest sort of free-willed soul to make whole-cloth through magic, particularly by other Free.
