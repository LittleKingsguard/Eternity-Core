The Free do not need a body to take Actions, even Physical ones. However, this is mentally strenuous and distracting from their self-maintenance, and thus every Action taken without a body costs 1 APA per AP spent. Entering a Scene without a body costs SPA per Spotlight spent to do so. Unbinding from a body may be done as part of any Action, but rebinding can only be done as part of a successful Recovery Action.

If a Free Soul takes a Physical Action without the use of a body, it is done with touch-range telekinesis. This may require creative use of Gear or Hazards to take any Actions or Reactions against mortals without being Opposed by the Protection of the Coil.

Conversely, the Free Soul enjoys functional immunity against Physical Attacks and Hazards, and ignores Physical Obstacles and Terrain unless they have an Aetheric presence (ex. Are infused or a living part of an ensouled being).
