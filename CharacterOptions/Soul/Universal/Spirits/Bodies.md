Unlike Mortals, who are born with a body and cannot easily acquire a new one, most Spirits are not fixed into any given body, and can depart one and willing enter or be brought into another as casually as mortals might change clothes. The specific means by which a Spirit changes bodies depends on the type of Spirit. Most Spirits can simply will into existence a new body by various magical means, in which case they choose Body traits as a Mortal does, or they may acquire and inhabit a Body Asset with more capability.

If a Spirit takes damage from Attacks, Physical Hazards, or other means of directly damaging their body, this does not directly damage the Spirit. Instead, they receive a Dilemma vs. abandoning their current Body, on which all such damage accumulates. This Dilemma can only cover APA and SPA damage, however; if the Spirit takes NPA damage from such a source or would be forced to clear their SPA due to such damage, they have one chance to escape it by immediately abandoning their physical Body or they take the damage directly, as they overstrain themselves forcing the wrecked body to work.
