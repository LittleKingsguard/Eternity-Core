The soul of a mortal is tied to their body by way of aetheric bindings of considerable power and durability, the Mortal Coil, making it highly resilient to the usual concerns that plague spirits. However, the body itself is quite fragile, and the bindings slowly wither and fade as the years go by, and the same power and durability that make them so protective also make them nearly impossible to repair. When either age or injury to the body breaks the bindings, the soul breaks free and the mortal dies. What happens next is up to the flow of the Aetheric currents, the purity of the departed soul, the interests of any attendant spirits and mages, and very likely the whims and current affairs of whichever psychopomp first finds them.

Restoring a mortal to life is technically possible, but the process so closely mirrors that of making a new mortal outright that many view it as the creation of a new soul which has inherited the memories and personality of the old.
