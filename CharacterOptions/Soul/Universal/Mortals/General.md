Humans, elves, dwarves, and many others scattered across the physical planes are the most common of the free-willed beings among the cosmos. Few planes can be found that do not have some native mortal species that has found its way there and made a home, and by a large margin they outnumber anything else short of the ephemeral sparks of the Free that have yet to build an identity, and the numberless Chained Demons of their scattered hellscape realms. Mortals come in a variety of subtypes, based on their heritage and origin.
