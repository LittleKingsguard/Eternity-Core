Blooded exist in a middle group between Mortals and Spirits, processing some advantages of both, but getting the full strength of neither. While they still possess the bindings of the Mortal Coil, their instincts are dulled by the inclusion of their Spirit ancestor's lack thereof. Likewise, possessing magic from birth often leads to them both never learning how to do many tasks by mundane means, and also being self-taught in basic fundamentals of said magic. (While those whose magical ancestors are still part of their life may have the benefit of a willing tutor, the difference in the anatomy of the soul between Spirits and mortals makes them notoriously awful teachers.)

As Mortals with innate magical power, Blooded are definitionally Tier I at the lowest, and like other Mortals can be found at any higher level even on the cosmic scale.
