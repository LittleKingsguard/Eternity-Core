While Blooded are mortals, circumstances rarely allow them to live a typical mortal’s life. The magic flowing through a Blooded child is instinctive, and they often grasp at least the basic fundamentals of how to use it at the same age most mortal children learn to walk, making it difficult to hide short of hiding the child’s existence completely.

If and when the wider society learns of the child’s magic, their life becomes shaped by expectation: Their obvious potential as a mage by itself is one shaping force, but often far stronger is the societies’ opinion on the Spirit parent. The descendants of Fiends and other such despised figures are often shunned, if not outright condemned, while any Spirit with a cult will often have their children be treated as literal royalty.

Layered on top of this are the quirks of someone who has possessed magic since their earliest memories, and the sometimes strange and powerful instincts and urges they inherit from their Spirit half that other mortals lack, and may often be unnecessary or counterproductive to the still technically mortal child. As an extreme example, Fiend-Blooded children often have a compulsion to cause pain and misery on others, which their supernatural empathy causes them to feel as if it were their own, in a feedback loop that usually leads to severe psychological issues.
