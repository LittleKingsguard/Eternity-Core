Most Blooded are first-generation, inheriting power from a Spirit parent, as the dilution of a bloodline means only relatively strong (and correspondingly rare and aloof) Spirits are capable of passing down enough power to run for multiple generations. The rare cases of such bloodlines, however, often mark the beginning of new and powerful aristocratic or royal families, as hereditary magical power translates swiftly into hereditary temporal power.
