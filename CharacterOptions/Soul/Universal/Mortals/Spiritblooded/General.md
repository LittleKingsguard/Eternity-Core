Technically a subtype of Mortal, Spirit-Blooded are mortals with a strong ancestral influence from some magical source, usually a Spirit but possibly a mortal mage significantly far down the path to transcendence. While to the lay mortal “Spirit-blooded” might simply mean anyone with outlandish, abnormal features, this can account for entire houses, tribes, cultures, or entire species who, despite glowing veins, metallic hair, animalistic appearance, or other such features, are metaphysically indistinguishable from any other mortal. 

Mages and Spirits typically reserve the word for those whose heritage is strong enough for the instinctive magic of the Spirit ancestor to pass on, giving the Blooded an awakened sense for the Aether and an affinity for their Spirit ancestor’s domain./workspaces/Eternity-Core/CharacterOptions/Soul/Universal/Mortals
