To unbind a mortal from their physical body is to kill them, and their binding will come undone in short order if critical components of it are lost, destroyed, or otherwise stop working, such as a human's brain, heart, blood, or other internal organs. This will kill the mortal, rendering them defeated. As this is directly relevant to their existence, their Body is not a separate Asset that can be attacked. Instead, if an Attack would harm their body, it becomes direct damage to be prevented with PA spending or taking a Loss.

A Mortal starts with 3 points of Traits that can be assigned to their Body, instead of having to spend any Asset value on it. If they start with any Talents that would allow them to add additional traits during play, they may also start with any such improvements already made.
