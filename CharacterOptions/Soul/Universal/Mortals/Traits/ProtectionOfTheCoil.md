While most mortals never develop the sense for it, the subconscious mind does have control over the power channeled through the Mortal Coil, and actively uses it to ward off magical influence. Any magical effect that directly manipulates the physical body of a mortal or anything they are touching (including the ground and air within engagement range) is passively opposed, using the Mortalâ€™s Persistence as the Primary Ability and being Upgraded once.

This does not protect against attacks that use magic to produce dangerous Physical effects, such as conjured weapons, hurled blasts of wind and fire, or telekinetically thrown projectiles. Attempts to telekinetically restrain or manhandle the target, or conjuring water or flames in or around them where they cannot reasonably dodge or evade will be resisted, however.
