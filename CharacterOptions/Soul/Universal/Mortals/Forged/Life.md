While Forged are mortal, and destroying their body will kill them as surely as it would any other, nearly all Forged are constructed of materials that stand the test of time better than living matter. This is a deliberate choice, of course; most beings that could Forge one would find having to replace their aging creations tiresome after a few milennia. Equally, it makes quite possible for a Forged to outlive their raison d'etre, or at least their creator's attention span, and so have to find something else to do with their life, assuming they ever cared about their created purpose in the first place.

While it is unusual for a Forged to be wholly opposed or even apathetic to their intended purpose, they are still possessed of free will and capable of finding other tasks, desires, and companions to busy themselves with, should their designed purpose prove insufficiently stimulating or obviously irrelevant. A Forged, created to guard a private sanctum, might be perfectly willing to spend ten thousand years alone. They would, however, likely have found some hobbies in the intervening time, and, should the sanctum wash away into the sea, they are perfectly capable of deciding their service is complete, or that they should at least track down their wayward creator to inform them of the bad news. This is as opposed to a Chained, who might fully acknowledge that their purpose is now pointless and futile, but be incapable of abandoning it.
