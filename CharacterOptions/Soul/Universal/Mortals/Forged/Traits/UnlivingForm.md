The Forged are immune to typical mortal concerns about age, food, water, sleep, and so on, but conversely, they do not gain the benefits of living flesh. When Recovering APA or SPA, the Forged uses the lower of their Persistence ratings to determine the amount of Plot Armor recovered, unless they take an Action or Scene to do so, and have access to appropriate tools, materials, and working space to craft replacement parts for their damaged or worn-out components. While making such a Recovery, they may also swap out components, replacing the traits on their Body with new ones, as long as they have a relevant Gear Asset or similar to represent the new parts.
