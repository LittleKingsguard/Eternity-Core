A Forged is limited in power and skill only by their creator's own knowledge, skill, and budget, and their own ability to improve on their creator's work. One bound into a small form of common stone or scrap metal might struggle to keep pace with a humble imp or fairy, while one wrought from incarnite could step forth from the foundry of their birth already a challenge to all but the mightiest gods and elder things.

While a Forged will certainly benefit from training and refinement of technique, this alone will not awaken the same nigh-unlimited potential it would have for other mortals, whose living bodies can adapt to their growing power. To fully realize their growth, the Forged must do this manually, refining their design and upgrading their physical shell, piece by piece.
