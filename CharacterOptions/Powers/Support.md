A Support Module is one that can be invoked without using turn order or Reactions, and even if the character is not directly part of the Scene. This usually represents something they either did before the Scene that contributes a bonus (ex. reconnaisance), will do after the Scene (ex. medical attention) or can do without being present (ex. a distraction). In exchange for not using action economy, invoking a Support Module has an outside cost, such as starting or intesifying a Crisis or costing the character Overload.

It should not be possible to create a character with no Support Module.
