# The Invisible Fist of Command

A highly cynical work on the laws of economics in mortal society that originally existed to serve as a primer on the complexities of trade, finance, and property for Unbound and other Spirits that may not be familiar with mortal society. While the zen style it shares with many other works written by and for Spirits frequently renders an already complicated and confusing topic even more impenetrable to mortal readers, it is possible to piece together a cohesive understanding of mirco- and macroeconomics out of its many koans, parables, and manuals. 

This is not the reason it is notorious, however. The Glittering Path, as it refers to the discipline of power that it advocates, is a brutally exploitative Material Art that seeks to gather power from the lives and labors of others without their knowledge.
