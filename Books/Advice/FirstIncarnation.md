A guidebook intended to catch newly created Unbound, Free, or Wild spirits up to basic, common-knowledge information about existing in the Physical Realm and how it may differ from Aetheric life. 

Prologue: Sight, literacy, and how to acquire them (Pictographic/Anima-encoded)

Chapter I: Existence -- Unused;

Chapter II: Natural Laws  
* Elasticity: Solid objects cannot be forced through each other without damage, and resist changes to their shape. If warped by impact or other outside forces, they will try to return to their original shape, pushing away from the impact in the process. This is referred to as 'bouncing'. -- Ricochet; 

Chapter III: Social Laws 
* A Mortal cannot simply reincarnate a new body when damaged, and must have their repaired. This process is usually quite long, inconvenient, and painful, and so forcing a Mortal into this is usually illegal, and almost always quite rude. -- Medic; 

Chapter IV: Mortal Cultures
* Mortals, as the name indicates, do not live long lives. Thus, when considering the future, they must live vicariously though others; traditionally, the other in question are often the progeny they have created, who will inherit the wealth and status of the martal after their death. Sustained over multiple generations, this can place fortunes accrued over centuries in the hands of mortals merely decades old. -- Aristocrat

Chapter VI:

Chapter VII:

Chapter VIII: Self-Defense 
* The body is a Physical thing, and bound by Physical laws. To restrain or break your own restraints, you must first understand these bindings, for all others are built from them. -- Wrestler;
