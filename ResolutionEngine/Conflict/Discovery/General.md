One character may attempt to Discover information about another character, such as their identity, any Assets they possess, Talents they know, their Abilities, Intimacies, and Flaws, and any Projects they have active and what progress they have made. This is usually a Mental Attack or Project that imposes a Dilemma vs. revealing the targeted information. The character must at least have a Lead on the target. This typically requires direct interaction with the target, or places they've been before and left evidence of their actions, but is usually covert.

Unlike Influence or Control, there are no firm rules on how severe a Dilemma must be to be worth revealing information; that decision is left entirely to the player whose secrets are getting probed. A Dilemma can have more than one piece of information associated with it, but all such information must have specific Leads.
