A Crisis has all the same components as a Project but doesn't have a controller to invoke a Dilemma against. Instead, characters Discover components as Miscellaneous Actions for Scene-level Crises or Goals for Storyboard-level Crises. The Goal must still have at least 1/1 Agency/Impact invested.

Depending on the nature of the Crisis, the GM/table may decide that some aspects should be Obvious or Overt, like the location of a major fire.
