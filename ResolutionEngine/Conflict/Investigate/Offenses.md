Any Action or Project that a character performs that would cause a Power to take direct action (if their identity and responsibility were proven) against them constitutes an Offense. 

An Offense can be smoothed over, atoned for, or buried as an Action or Project of equal D/R and higher Tier than the Offending Action, or by sacrificing a Connections or other relevant Asset of equal Bonus and Tier.
 
Design Notes:
The gameâ€™s assumption is that the natural progress of any official investigation will be too slow to affect the story, and to make progress other characters will have to advance it.
