If three Tiers are spent increasing the scale, the Trap lasts as Enduring but also continues into all future Scenes at that Location.

The character setting the trap may passively Join any Scene with Goals set to Counter the Trap, by retroactively explaining how they foresaw different attempts and took steps to complicate them.

The character setting the Trap does not get this bonus against attempts leveraging Talents or Assets they didnâ€™t know about. On the scale of a Permanent Trap, it may be easier or faster to bypass simply by acquiring a new relevant Asset. The controller of the Trap may update it to account for new knowledge between Scenes for free unless there is no plausible way they could have done so, however.
