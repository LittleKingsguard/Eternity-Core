Traps act effectively as a reversed Control Dilemma. Rather than forcing a target to accept a status or take a certain Action or take damage, they instead threaten a target with damage if they do take a certain Action. The acting player takes all of the steps for making the Attack, Influence, Control, or other Conflict Action that would be the consequence of the Trap, and then, instead of rolling, notes the Abilities chosen and any bonuses applied before naming the blocked Action that would trigger it. If the target performs the blocked Action, the character then rolls the Action put on hold previously. This is a passive Action that does not have a cost. 

The target may still React to the Trap, though some Reactions may implicitly require abandoning their triggering Action to do so, such as Evading a surprise counterattack taking them out of range for their originally-planned Attack.

If the Trap involves Assets or Talents the target has not Discovered, the character may treat their Surprise or Stealth status vs. the target as one degree more severe.

However, even the best-laid plans are often thwarted by the unknown unknowns, and the target’s player may instead choose to negate the Trap by revealing an unknown Asset or Talent that changes the prohibited act enough that the planned counter would no longer apply. For example, mining the exits to a Scene doesn’t matter if the intended target then uses previously-unseen parkour skills to leave via the walls instead.

The largest effect the Trap can have is dependent on the highest PA Track the associated damage affects.

Design Notes:
A Trap is not necessarily a literal, physical trap; a character in a melee fight altering their stance so that the best approach for a given opponent is actually an easily-countered false opening would be a Trap blocking off a direct Attack from the target enemy, as would establishing a well-flanked killbox for anyone entering a specific Zone in a firefight, or even setting an opponent up for a scathing retort in a debate.
