A Stinger is a special sort of Cutaway that a character can choose immediately after the resolution of another Scene. The Stinger must chain directly off the preceding Scene, and costs only 1 SP isntead of 2 SP as normal for Scenes.

As the Stinger is not *in medias res* of another Scene, it can be started or joined by characters that were participating in the previous Scene.
