A Flashback is a Scene started from inside another Scene, showing something the character starting the Flashback did in the past. A Flashback is always resolved as a Quick Scene, even if another character Reacts to join it, in which case they Support or Oppose the roll as they would for an Action.

Flashbacks normally cannot have an immediate, hostile direct effect on another character, though clever use of them may allow literal or metaphorical “old wounds” to be targeted in the present.

Any character, in the Scene or outside of it, may declare a Flashback at any time for the cost of 2 Spotlight.
