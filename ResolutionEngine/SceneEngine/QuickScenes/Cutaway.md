A Cutaway is a Scene declared during another Scene, but focusing on what other characters are doing in the present. 

Similarly to Flashbacks, Cutaways are Quick Scenes even if others Join. 

However, Cutaways cannot be directly started by, joined by, or target characters that are already in an existing Scene, unlike Flashbacks, but can have immediate effects. Ally or Follower Assets or similar effects may allow a character in-Scene to start or join a Cutaway by proxy, however.
