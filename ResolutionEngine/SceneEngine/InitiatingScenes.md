In the Narrative level, a player starting the Scene describes (within reason) the circumstances of the Scene, defines a Primary Ability Group for the Scene overall, and then chooses the Supporting group that they specifically will use for the Scene.
Any other characters joining must use the same Primary Ability Group, if they have it, or the closest available equivalent if they do not. The Supporting Group may be chosen freely.

Once all characters have either joined or declined, the GM/table then decides whether the Scene should be a Quick Scene or a Focus Scene.

The combination of these groups gives the player Agency and Impact with which to define their Goals for the Scene in the same way these groups define Dice and Power for Actions.

Goal Creation progresses in the order of the character starting the Scene, then in order of the starting player's choice. The target, if any, may insert themselves into the order any any point, if they actively Joined the Scene. If a character is only in the Scene because they are a target, they do not get Goals. Additionally, choose whether characters enter the Scene in Stealth. If a character has any Overt Assets they wish to bring into the Scene with them, they cannot be in Stealth unless they pay the Asset's Tier + 1 in Agency and Impact for each such Asset.

Characters are not required to spend all available Agengy/Impact on Goals. Any unspent Agency/Impact grants [Support Bonuses](https://github.com/LittleKingsguard/Eternity-Core/blob/13f4d3cafe1dc1d1c1dfa71870143d833680c80b/ResolutionEngine/SceneEngine/SupportBonuses.md) during the Scene.

After all Goals are established, play shifts into the Scene itself.
