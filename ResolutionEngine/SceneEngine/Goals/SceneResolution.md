At the end of the Scene, discard all declared Goals that were not successfully completed. 
Group all remaining Goals by intent, i.e. Project they advance, character they Conflict with, etc., and then by Tier within those groups.
Total the Agency and Impact of each subgroup.
If any subgroup has more than 5 Agency or 10 Impact, 4 Agency or 8 Impact must be spent to upgrade the Tier. If there is another subgroup with that tier, combine the totals.
Discard all but the highest Tier subgroup.
Upgrade the final total of each group twice, and then apply them towards their respective intents as Actions, using Agency as Successes and Impact as Power.

Design Notes:
The intention of Scene Resolution process is to map victory conditions in a Scene to the Action framework to avoid having the narrative and in-Scene levels of the game work on different frameworks for handling Projects, preparations, damage, etc.
