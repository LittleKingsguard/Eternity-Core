If introducing a Scene Goal as an Minion or Troop, the Minion's Dice and Power ratings equal half of the amount of Agency and Impact invested in the Goal, respectively. It is one Tier greater than the Goal itself, and should be given a Specialty relevant to the challenge it poses.

Defeating the Minions in direct combat, Influencing them to submit or retreat, or preventing them from accomplishing a defined task during the Scene may all count as completing the Goal.

Design notes:
Minions as Goals are meant to provide a direct, active antagonist for the Scene, and it should be assumed that the Minion or Troop is hostile, or at least will be made hostile in the process of the Scene. A neutral third-party that represents the Goal the player wishes to achieve but has no incentive to stop them from pursuing other Goals would be better represented as a more abstract form of Obstacle or Crisis.

Minions have a lower Tier adjustment than Obstacle Goals because they take independent Actions and thus force characters to respond. Additionally, depending on how aggressively/intelligently they are played, they can actively accelerate Crises or Oppose attempts to complete other Goals, making them a significant source of complications in the Scene. However, they are also more vulnerable to being defeated in one or two Actions than Crises are.
