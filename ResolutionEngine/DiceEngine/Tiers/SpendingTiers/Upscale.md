If the Action has targets or affects an area, increase the size of that area, increasing from Single Target → Engagement → Entire Zone → Adjacent Zones → Entire Scene

Increasing above Full Scene may have narrative-scale effects, but will not immediately impact the scene.
These Tiers must be spent before the roll.
