The Soft Cap on any value is the total of both Abilities that affect that value, such as the Primary and Supporting Abilities for an Action, Reaction, or Scene Start/Join, or the two Ability Groups chosen to determine Spotlight/Resources or AP/Effort. This includes any points from this value that have been spent, as with AP, Spotlight, Resources, or Effort, or Dice or Power spent to add other modifiers to an Action.
In general, the Soft Cap is the maximum value that can be achieved through entirely internal means, such as spending Effort to raise Power or add Dice, or Plot Armor to gain more Spotlight/Resources or AP/Effort. Outside methods such as Support from other characters' Reactions, Assets being used, Preparations, etc. bypass the Soft Cap.
