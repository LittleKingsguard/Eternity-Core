Support Powers are effects the character can perform outside of turn order, without spending AP, or even being in the Scene directly. These are made available by specific character Powers, and each character should have at least 1. In exchange for ignoring usual action economy limits, they should come with higher prices or greater drawbacks than other powers, such as costing Overload with each use.
