Reactions are ways that characters can respond to the Actions of another character, the consequences of a Crisis or Hazard, or similar trigger. Reactions cost 1 AP.

If the trigger of the Reaction is another character's Action or Reaction, the Reaction is declared just before the Action is rolled, after the rolling player has committed to any decisions about spending Effort, exchanging Dice for Power or Tiers, etc.
If the trigger is a Crisis or Hazard, the Reaction applies immediately.
In either case, the Reaction "rolls" and resolves before the triggering effect does.

Instead of rolling, Reactions simply treat half of the dice being rolled as Successes.
The “roll” for the Reaction may still be enhanced by spending Effort or spending dice/power on Tiers or Talents, as normal.

Characters may almost always React towards Actions that target themselves or a character they are Engaged with, and can usually React to Actions taken by Engaged characters, provided they have a means of assisting or hindering the Action. doing so with non-Engaged characters typically takes specialized Gear, Talents, or Guard/Prepare Actions in advance.

Design Notes:
Reactions are unrolled to minimize the amount of time physically spent rolling, as Reactions can be much more frequent than Actions, and to reduce the variability of final roll outcomes and thus the swinginess of a conflict.
