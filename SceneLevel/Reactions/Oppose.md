A character opposing the Action raises the Difficulty/Resistance/Scale of the Challenge to the result of their roll. If it already had a specified D/R/S, the character may treat that as a Fixed Bonus to their own roll. If an Action is Opposed by multiple Reactions, only the highest roll applies, though any rider effects or traits still take effect. Any character that could validly Oppose an Action qualifies to Assist another character's Oppose attempt, even if they otherwise could not React to that character's Actions or Reactions.

An Oppose attempt cannot itself be Opposed, but a character that would have the opportunity always qualifies to Assist the original Action.

Design Notes:
Oppose Reactions, unlike Assist, are intended to contest Action rolls on equal terms, thus Successes directly convert to Difficulty instad of Dice, and Power is not halved. Oppose attempts cannot be Opposed because this lack of halving means allowing Opposes to Opposes would frequently stop the original Reaction from succeeding at all, making a two-on-one advantage impossible to overcome. Allowing characters that could otherwise intervene to Support the original Action instead is thus a compromise that allows them to have an effect via a better-scaling mechanical framework.
