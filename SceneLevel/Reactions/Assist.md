Supporting an Action gives the acting character extra dice equal to the number of successes on the Reaction, and half the Reactionâ€™s Power.

As usual for Bonuses, if an effect is being Supported by multiple Reactions, only the strongest Bonus applies, though any other traits or rider effects still apply. However, other character's Support Reactions may themselves be Supported, increasing the total.

Design Notes:
The ability to "chain" Support Reactions off of each other is intended to allow teamwork to scale with diminishing returns. Each successive Reaction adding half its Dice and Power to the next roll produces an inverse-square falloff.
The first Supporter adds 1/1 Dice/Power for every 2 Dice/Power they have.
The second Supporter adds that Dice/Power to the first Supporter, meaning they need to add a total of 2 Dice/Power to the first Supporter to increase the bonus for the final Action by 1/1. This takes them 4/4 Dice/Power.
The third Supporter adds to the second, thus to add 1/1 to the final Action roll they will have to contribute 4/4 to the second Supporter. This will take them 8/8 Dice/Power.
Any further Supporters are blocked by the hard cap of 10/10 on Dice/Power at the time of the roll, and can thus only force a direct contribution by raising full Tiers.
