If a character or one of their Major Intimacies are under threat, they may attempt a Save, removing their Protection from the Action's Power on Step 9, even if they Reacted, if it has already been applied, or even if it has been negated by the spending of a Tier. The character responsible for the threat may spend another Tier to negate this Protection as well.
