Scenes
The structure of a scene mirrors that of the Narrative, above, with the following differences:
Action Points (AP) are used in place of Spotlight, and are spent to declare Actions or React to other Actions. Starting and Maximum AP is calculated the same as for Spotlight, except using the Primary/Secondary Abilities chosen for the Scene.
Effort is used in place of Resources, and is spent to raise the Power of rolls or invoke Talents. Starting and Maximum Effort is calculated the same as for Resources, except using the Primary/Secondary Abilities chosen for the Scene.
Initiative takes the place of Priority, being bought with AP at the start of each Round and determining turn order within the Round.
Quick Scenes
If a character starts a Scene unopposed, for the sake of speeding up the plot to get to a point where more players get to act, the Scene may be resolved in the manner of an Action, rolling the Abilities chosen for the Scene and applying any relevant Talents or other Bonuses, then distributing the resulting Successes and Power across the Goals chosen for the Scene. The player then briefly explains what they did to accomplish (or fail) those Goals and play returns to the Narrative.
Flashbacks
A Flashback is a Scene started from inside another Scene, showing something the character starting the Flashback did in the past. A Flashback is always resolved as a Quick Scene, even if another character Reacts to join it, in which case they Assist or Oppose the roll as they would for an Action.

Flashbacks normally cannot have an immediate, hostile direct effect on another character, though clever use of them may allow literal or metaphorical “old wounds” to be targeted in the present.

Any character, in the Scene or outside of it, may declare a Flashback at any time for the cost of 2 Spotlight.
Cutaways
A Cutaway is a Scene declared during another Scene, but focusing on what other characters are doing in the present. Similarly to Flashbacks, Cutaways are Quick Scenes even if others Join. However, Cutaways cannot be directly started by, joined by, or target characters that are already in an existing Scene, unlike Flashbacks, but can have immediate effects. Ally or Follower Assets or similar effects may allow a character in-Scene to start or join a Cutaway by proxy, however.
Plot Armor
The Action PA track is the most dynamic, Recovering at the end of every round. All damage heals at the end of each scene. If the Action track is exhausted, it refills to full at the cost of 1 point of Scene PA, mirroring the Scene track, above.
Beginning of Scene
If the Scene has a Target, that character or Asset and any friendly characters may start the Scene wherever their players consider the most likely location. All others must start the Scene in a Zone with an Exit.

Characters do not have any knowledge on whether any characters they are not Tracking or in Contact with are in the Scene, regardless of whether they chose to enter in Stealth, until they actually detect them. If a character is not in Stealth, however, they are automatically and passively detected at the first opportunity.

Any characters that chose to enter into the Scene in Stealth are Undetected (or Unknown, as appropriate) to any non-allied characters who are not Tracking or in Contact with them, and Hidden to any that are.
Rounds
The Primary Ability chosen to get the character’s AP/Effort for the round is determined by the player that started the Scene. The Secondary Ability is chosen separately for each Character. Exerting for more AP or Effort costs PA on the Action track (APA).
Turn
On a character’s turn within a scene, they may declare an Action. As above with Scenes, they may start additional Actions at any time after for 2 AP each, up to a total of their starting AP.
Reaction
Instead of participating in a scene, a Reaction at the Scene scope involves the character opposing or Assisting the Action or Reaction triggering it.
Blitz
If a character has not taken their turn yet and wishes to React to an Action, they will have to pay an additional 1 AP for every two points of Initiative between the current turn and their own.

They may instead take a Dice penalty equal to the difference in Initiative.
Multiple Attempts
If a character takes multiple Reactions to the same prompt, ex. Both dodging and using a Talent to counterattack an attack, each subsequent Reaction costs +1 AP. A similar penalty applies to attempts to React to a Reaction (ex. Dodging a counterattack.) This penalty is cumulative.
Passive Reactions
Some effects such as Armor or certain Talents allow characters to take a specific type of Reaction (usually Opposing an incoming Attack) passively. Such Reactions do not cost AP and do not suffer penalties from Blitz, but cannot be boosted by spending Effort or other voluntary effects such as Chaining. Any bonus from something granting a Passive Reaction always applies to that Reaction, however.
Free Reaction
A Free Reaction does not cost AP but is otherwise normal.
Saves
If a character or one of their Major Intimacies are under threat, they may attempt a Save, Reacting without any AP cost, penalties, and without concern for any statuses limiting their options. They also gain bonus Dice/Power equal to their LCK/WILL. However, this roll costs 1 SPA, and the character takes a 2nd degree status of the attacker’s choosing.
Movement and Distance
Scenes are divided up into Zones. Zones are large regions of the map or Scene that are separated from each other by Obstacles, Hazards, Choke Points, or other dividing features. Unless an Action may be taken at Range, it may only be used on targets within the same Zone as the acting Character. 

Characters may move between Zones as an Action. Additionally, they may also move via Drift.
Drifting
Drift represents the way cinematic action tends to wander around the setpiece, with fights turning into back-and-forth chases depending on who has the advantage without interrupting the action to turn tail and run away. At the beginning of every round after the start of a Scene, immediately after Initiative is decided and in descending order of Initiative, Characters may choose to either Drift or Pursue.

A Drifting character chooses an adjacent Zone to move to, and optionally may choose to spend AP or Effort on this motion. If they cannot cross into this Zone without passing an Obstacle, they must spend AP equal to its Difficulty, if any, and Effort equal to half its Resistance, if any. Likewise, they will be affected by any Hazard they Drift through without paying. If the Obstacle/Hazard has a higher Tier than the Scene’s Escalation, increase the AP/Effort cost by 4 for each Tier.

A Pursuing character waits until after all Drifting characters have declared their intentions, then may choose to either follow a Drifting character, spending to cross any Obstacles or Hazards as above, or staying in place. If they stay, they may choose to force a Drifting character to stay with them by spending a higher total of AP and Effort than they did.
End of Round
After the last character has taken their turn and all Reactions have been resolved, the Round ends. Any “End of Action round” crisis effects trigger, then all characters Recover on the Action track.
End of Scene
A scene ends and play returns to the Narrative scope when one of several things happens:
All remaining players involved agree there are no more useful actions to be made, at least without a serious tone/environment change (ex. Heist → chase, party → shootout)
The character that started the scene has succeeded in their goal and they and all their allies have and left the scene
Dramatic Escape
At any point during a scene, a participating character may make a Dramatic Escape, where events contrive (at significant risk or expense to the character) to separate them from any immediate danger and let them flee the scene.

The cost of a Dramatic Escape is normally 1 NPA, or a Narrative-scope Dilemma, and cannot be reduced below this. If one of the goals of the scene is attacking the escaping character, see Conflict Goals, above.

Any NPA damage the character has taken during the Scene, is currently being taken when they choose to Dramatically Escape, or that they take as a consequence of a Conflict Goal may be considered towards this cost if the player can contrive how those actions eject them from the scene.
Exiting a Scene
A character that is in a Zone with an Exit Point may choose to Exit the scene as an action. This fails if any character successfully opposes their attempt.
Return to Narrative
At the end of the Scene, any completed Goals are tallied up and assessed as under Scene Resolution, above, then all characters not part of the Scene learn of any Overt events that occurred during the Scene and any knowledge relevant to them. Finally, play resumes in the Narrative level.
Transitions
At the end of the fourth and every subsequent Round of a Scene, roll a single die. On a success, nothing happens. On a failure, the Scene is paused as play immediately transitions back to the Narrative level as described under Return to Narrative, above, except that the Scene continues. Any characters not in the Scene may decide to Join the Scene, or start a different Scene following the normal rules, except that any character in the existing Scene cannot Join the newly-created one.

Assuming the new Scene is not abbreviated as a cutscene, it is recommended to put playing through it on hold until the current Scene ends, although the two are concurrent in Narrative time. Any new characters joining the Scene have Goals established as normal, though they cannot contradict other information established during the Scene.

Finally, if any Offenses have been revealed or Overtly committed, the GM or Table may choose to add Minions acting on behalf of the offended power. Play then continues, and the countdown until the Transition die gets rolled resets.
