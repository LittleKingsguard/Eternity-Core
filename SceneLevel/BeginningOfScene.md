See [Initiating Scenes](https://github.com/LittleKingsguard/Eternity-Core/blob/8487a87b348ba463a9237bb567457a3392376ce9/ResolutionEngine/SceneEngine/InitiatingScenes.md) for creating Scenes at the Narrative Level, defining the Goals and Abilities chosen, and deciding whether to begin a Quick Scene or a Focus Scene. The remainder of this section applies only to Focus Scenes.

At the beginning of a Scene, the initiating player (or the player of the target, if the Scene's location is relevant to them) describes the location and the matter at hand. The players of other Joining characters may then describe their own Goals and place them in the Scene.

Characters do not have any knowledge on whether any characters they are not Tracking or in Contact with are in the Scene until the other character does something to be noticed. If a character is not attempting to stay hidden, however, they are automatically and passively detected at the first opportunity.

Once the Scene is fully set, the first Round begins.
