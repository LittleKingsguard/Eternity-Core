See [Initiating Scenes](https://github.com/LittleKingsguard/Eternity-Core/blob/8487a87b348ba463a9237bb567457a3392376ce9/ResolutionEngine/SceneEngine/InitiatingScenes.md) for creating Scenes at the Narrative Level, defining the Goals and Abilities chosen, and deciding whether to begin a Quick Scene or a Focus Scene. The remainder of this section applies only to Focus Scenes.

At the beginning of a Scene, the player starting the Scene chooses a map relevant to the Location, and all present characters must be positioned on the map. If the Location or a relevant Asset is controlled by any present character, or a character is Targeted as part of the initiating Character's Goals, that character and all allied characters may start anywhere within the Scene. All other characters must start in an Exit Zone.

Likewise, the objects of any Scene Goals must be placed into the Scene according to how they where chosen to be represented (ex. a Goal blocked by a Physical Obstacle should actually be behind doors/walls/other security and not conveniently in the same Exit Zone as the character with that Goal). If the Goal relates to an Asset or other aspect controlled by a character, that character's player gets final say over where this is.

Characters do not have any knowledge on whether any characters they are not Tracking or in Contact with are in the Scene, regardless of whether they chose to enter in Stealth, until they actually detect them. If a character is not in Stealth, however, they are automatically and passively detected at the first opportunity.

Any characters that chose to enter into the Scene in Stealth are Undetected (or Unknown, as appropriate) to any non-allied characters who are not Tracking or in Contact with them, and Hidden to any that are.

Once the Scene is fully set, the first Round begins.
