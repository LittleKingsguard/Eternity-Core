When using a Passive Support, the player may choose to apply it normally, or Go Hot. Going Hot provides more uses and makes each use stronger, but comes with downsides for one or both characters involved.

Going Hot always costs 1 Resources when done for the first time in a Scene, and frequently has additional costs for each use.
