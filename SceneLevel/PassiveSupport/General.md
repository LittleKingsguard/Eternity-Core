Passive Support is an bonus that characters not present in the Scene can provide if they have joined passively, representing help they provided before the Scene, such as reconnaissance or planning, *will* provide afterwards, such as healing or examination, or can supply without their physical presence, such as having their reputation invoked or acting as a distraction elsewhere. The options fr Passive Support a character has are dependent on the Roles they chose for the Act, and the Talents or Assets they have.

Each character can provide a total number of Passive Supports equal to the Primary Action rating chosen for the Scene, or the sum of both Action Ability Ratings if Going Hot. When relevant, the Power of a Passive Support is equal to the Power rating of the Primary Ability chosen, or the sum of both if Going Hot.
