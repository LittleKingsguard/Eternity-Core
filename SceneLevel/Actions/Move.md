A move action that does not cross a Hazard, Obstacle, or enters or leaves a Zone of Difficult Terrain (Environment, below) succeeds without a roll unless opposed. If such a feature is present, a roll must be made vs. its Difficulty/Resistance. If the roll fails against an Obstacle or Difficult Terrain, the character fails to move. If it is a Hazard, the character still succeeds but suffers the Hazard in passing.

Only one roll is made for all challenges facing the Action, and the Difficulty/Resistance of all challenges of the highest Tier is cumulative.
