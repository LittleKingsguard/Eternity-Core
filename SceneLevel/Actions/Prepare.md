Preparing gives a bonus to a future Action or Reaction with Dice equal to the roll's Successes, Power equal to half that of the roll, and equivalent Tier. The player may choose to spend a Tier to make the bonus instead apply to all valid rolls until the end of the Scene or until dismissed under a Dilemma.
