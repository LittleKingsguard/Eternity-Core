An Initiate action attempts to introduce a new Crisis or Project into the scene. The player describes what the character intends to set up and the way they plan to go about it, the intended Successes, Power and Tier of the completed Project, and, correspondingly, the D/R/Tier of the Progress Actions required to advance it. They then take a Progress Action towards this Project as part of this Action.
