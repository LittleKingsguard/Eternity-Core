Conflict actions are those that target other characters with hostile intention or otherwise affecting them unwillingly. If the Conflict attempt is at least the same Tier as the target's Defense Tier, the Action deals damage to the target's APA track equal to the roll's Power, or offers a Dilemma threatening that much damage. If the attempt is of higher Tier, the player may spent Tiers to increase the Track damaged as normal.
