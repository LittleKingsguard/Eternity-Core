Conflict actions are those that target other characters with hostile intention or otherwise affecting them unwillingly. If the Conflict attempt is at least the same Tier as the target's Defense Tier, the Action adds Distraction equal to the roll's Power, or offers a Dilemma threatening that much damage. If the attempt is of higher Tier, the player may spend a Tier to cause Stress instead, or 2 further Tiers to directly attack Plot Armor, as normal.
