Acquire Actions are used to make or otherwise acquire Assets, including Gear, converting Leads into Evidence, and so on. The final Asset produced cannot have a Dice/Power bonus (including any traits equivalent to such bonuses) greater than the roll. The Tier of the Asset, relative to the roll, is determined based on the type and traits of the Asset. 

Design Note:
For most permanent Assets, this will require a Project, either in the Scene or potentially even created in the Storyboard, because the Tier of the Action must be two or more higher than the Asset produced.
