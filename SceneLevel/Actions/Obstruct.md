An Obstruct Action introduces a new Obstacle into the Scene, blocking terrain, foiling an investigation, shutting someone out of a conversation, etc. 

The D/R/Tier of the Obstacle equals the Successes/Power/Tier of the roll, and the Obstacle does not have any consequences by default, though clever use of terrain, talents, or other features may introduce them.
