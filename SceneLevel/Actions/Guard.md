A Guarding character rolls as if for a Reaction, ex. Blocking incoming attacks, then may apply the results of that roll against all triggers valid for that reaction until their next Action without paying the base 1 AP cost per Reaction. Any penalties to the cost, such as from reaction to a Reaction (ex. Guarding against attempts to oppose someone else Exiting the scene) still have to be paid.
