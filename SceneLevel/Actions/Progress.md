A Progress Action attempts to advance work on one of a character’s Projects, obstruct progress on another character’s Project, or advance or mitigate a Crisis. When affecting an existing Project or Challenge, the player describes how they are obstructing or advancing it and then rolls against the D/R/Tier of the target, either lowering or advancing the Project or Crisis by 1 step on a success and raising or lowering any Progress on it by the remaining Power.
