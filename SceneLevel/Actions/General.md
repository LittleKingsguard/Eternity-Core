Actions are the individual, independent moves characters make during a Scene. All characters gain one free Action on their turn during a Round, and may take additional ones by spending AP. Most Actions are resolved by a roll, though some simply automatically succeed unless Opposed.

Unless otherwise stated, the Difficulty for an Action is 1, and they have 0 Resistance. If the Scene was Escalated when it was started, Actions within the Scene must have a minimum required Tier of at least double the number of Escalations.

The Dice or Power of an Action can be raised by a total of 2, up to the Soft Cap of both, by spending Effort.
