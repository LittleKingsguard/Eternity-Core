Actions are the individual, independent moves characters make during a Scene. All characters gain one free Action on their turn during a Round, and may take additional ones by spending AP. Most Actions are resolved by a roll, though some simply automatically succeed unless Opposed.

Unless otherwise stated, the Difficulty for an Action is 1, and they have 0 Resistance. If the Scene was Escalated when it was started, Actions within the Scene must have a minimum required Tier equal to the number of Escalations.

The Dice or Power of an Action can be raised by accepting 1 Distraction per 2 points, up to a total of the Soft Cap.

If a roll would create a set D/R/S for a challenge (ex. Initiating a Crisis, Obstructing another character), the final Successes/Power/Tier of the roll directly map to this difficulty.  
If a roll would apply a bonus (ex. Prepare Action, Acquiring an Asset) to a future roll or an ally's current roll, halve the Power before mapping the roll to the bonus.
