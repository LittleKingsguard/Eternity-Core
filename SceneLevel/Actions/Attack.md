Attack actions are those that target other characters with the intention to harm them. If the Attack is at least the same Tier as the target's Defense Tier, the Action deals damage to the target's APA track equal to the roll's Power. If the Attack is of higher Tier, the player may spent Tiers to increase the Track damaged as normal.

**Lethal**
Attacks may have the Lethal trait, raising the Track receiving damage by one level, as with spending a Tier. Lethal is not cumulative.
