At the end of the fourth Round of a Scene, the Scene is paused as play immediately transitions back to the Narrative level as described under [End Of Scene](https://github.com/LittleKingsguard/Eternity-Core/blob/8487a87b348ba463a9237bb567457a3392376ce9/ResolutionEngine/SceneEngine/Goals/SceneResolution.md), except that the Scene continues. Any characters not in the Scene may decide to Join the Scene, or start a different Scene following the normal rules, except that any character in the existing Scene cannot Join the newly-created one. Once any such Scenes have been declared, the Priority Count continues by one before play resumes in the current Scene.

If any new Scenes started are Focus Scenes, they are put on hold until the current Scene ends and played through retroactively. 

Any new characters joining the current Scene can have Goals established as normal, though they cannot contradict other information established during the Scene. 

A Scene can Transition multiple times if it continues for another four Rounds after the last Transition.

Players *can* elect to simply declare a Transition before the fourth Round to represent deliberate stalling/distraction, or to represent a major change in the nature of a Scene that would attract the attention of different characters. Doing so is the same as for a normal Transition, but does not advance the Priority count.
