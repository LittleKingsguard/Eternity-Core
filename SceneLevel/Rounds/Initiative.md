At the start of each Round, after gaining Action Points/Effort, all character may spend AP on increasing their Intiative.
After all characters have done so, Intiative starts at the highest score among all characters. 
At the first Intiative count, any characters at that count take their turn. The Priority count is then decremented by 1.

On all subsequent counts, all characters with a higher Intiative may, in descending order of Intiative, choose to take an additional Action by spending 2 AP. 
After this, play continues to any characters at that count, as above.

A character cannot take more than one Action on the same Initiative count, though they may Multitask by spending Tiers. If more than one character has the same Initiative, the players may choose their order. 

If a character Reacts to an Action on a higher Initiative count than their own, they lose Dice and Power equal to the difference. They may spend additional AP to reduce this penalty by 2 Dice per AP spent.

Design notes:
Intiative is mechanically identical to Priority, only differing in that it exists in the Scene level.
