At the beginning of each Round, all characters gain AP and Effort based on the Primary and Supporting Abilities they have chosen for the Scene, or Dice and Power for Minions. 

After this, AP may be spent on increasing character's Initiative point-for-point. This decision is made simultaneously for all characters, and while coordination between allies is recommended, Adversaries decisions' should be independent.

Then, on on all Rounds after the first Round of a Scene, all characters may choose to Drift.

After this, the Round proceeds by Initiative countdown.
