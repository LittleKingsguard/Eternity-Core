At the beginning of each Round, all characters gain AP, with each character gaining AP equal to the number of players. 

After this, AP may be spent on increasing character's Initiative point-for-point. This decision is made simultaneously for all characters, and while coordination between allies is recommended, Adversaries decisions' should be independent.

After this, the Round proceeds by Initiative countdown.
