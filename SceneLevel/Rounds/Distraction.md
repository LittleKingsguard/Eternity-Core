Distraction is a Scene-level-only counterpart to Stress. Characters may take Distraction in the following ways:
* As a consequence of damage
* Accepting it point-for-point to gain more AP. If the AP is spent immediately, Distraction is not increased until after the Action/Reaction.
* Accepting points to gain 2 dice/power per point on a roll, up to the soft cap. Distraction is increased after the Action.

Distraction functions as a debuff to all future Action rolls or Assist Reactions in the scene, decreasing Dice and/or Power by a total equal to the Distraction.
In lieu of affecting Oppose Reactions, any hostile Actions targeting the character may use it as a Floating Bonus.  
The player may always choose to spend 1 Stress to zero out Distraction before rolling with the above penalties. They *must* do this if they would otherwise roll 0 Dice.

Distraction is reduced by the character's Recovery at the end of the Round.

Design Notes:
Oppose Reactions are unaffected in favor of giving attackers a floating bonus to discourage players from facetanking attacks with Protection to avoid the penalty.
