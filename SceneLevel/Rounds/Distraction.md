Distraction is a Scene-level-only counterpart to Overload. Characters may take Distraction in the following ways:
* As a consequence of damage
* Accepting it point-for-point to gain more AP.
* Accepting points to gain 2 dice/power per point on a roll, up to the soft cap.

Distraction accumulates, and on any roll the player controlling that character's opposing Adversary/Hero decides is important, they may choose to spend any or all points of Distraction to reduce the final Dice and/or Power of the roll after all other bonuses/penalties. The controlling player may choose to spend 1 Overload to ignore the penalties instead.

Distraction is reduced by the character's Recovery at the end of the Round.
