The structure of a Round mirrors that of the Act structure, with the following exceptions:
* The Round structure uses different currency names for clarity (Initiative, AP, Effort, mirroring Priority, Spotlight, and Effort, respectively)
* Only characters that are acting in the Scene are included
* Minions and Troops present in the Scene also take independent Actions and have Initiative
* Action takes place in the map instead of the Storyboard
* Characters Recover on the Action track at the end of the Round
* In-Scene Crises advance at the end of each Round
* At the start of each Round after the first, characters may choose to Drift
