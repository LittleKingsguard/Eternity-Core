The structure of a Round mirrors that of the Act structure, with the following exceptions:
* The Round structure uses different currency names for clarity (Initiative, AP, and Distraction, mirroring Priority, Spotlight, and Stress, respectively)
* Only characters that are acting in the Scene are included
* Minions present in the Scene also take independent Actions and have Initiative
* Action takes place in the Scene instead of the Storyboard
* Characters Recover on the Action track at the end of the Round
* In-Scene Crises advance at the end of each Round
