Action Points (AP) is gained at the start of each Round, derived from the Scene's chosen Action Abilities. The total can be raised up to the soft cap by spending APA on a point-for-point basis.

Action Points are used for taking additional Actions during the Round, Reacting to other character's Actions, and raising the character's Initiative.
Each point of Initiative costs 1 AP.
Reacting costs 1 AP, plus any extra to negate Blitz penalties from the starting character having higher Initiative.
Taking an additional Action costs 2 AP, and can only be done after the character's turn.

Design Notes:
Action Points are mechanically identical to Spotlight (SP), only at the Scene level.
