The Round ends when all characters have taken their turn and none are willing or able to take an additional Action by spending AP.

Then, any in-Scene crises or similar end-of-Round effects trigger.
If specific order would matter in either case, the players of any instigating charcters can decide or settle it by contested roll.

Finally, all remaining active characters Recover APA. If this is the fourth Round of the Scene, it goes through a Transition. Otherwise, the next Round begins.
