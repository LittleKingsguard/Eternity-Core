Effort (E) is gained at the start of each Round, derived from the Scene's chosen Effort Abilities. The total can be raised up to the soft cap by spending APA on a point-for-point basis.

Effort represents additional reserves of strength or focus that the character can push into an attempt, but would exhaust them if they tried operating at that level every time.
By spending 1 E, the character can increase the Dice or Power of a roll by a total of 2.
Many Talents require Effort to be spent to activate.

Design Notes:
Following the general pattern of Rounds mirroring Acts, Effort is a Scene-level counterpart to Resources.
