At any point during a scene, a participating character may make a Dramatic Escape, where events contrive (at significant risk or expense to the character) to separate them from any immediate danger and let them flee the scene.

The cost of a Dramatic Escape is normally 1 NPA, or a Narrative-scope Dilemma, and cannot be reduced below this. Additionally it triggers any direct Conflict Goals, and may have additional costs imposed by any completed indirect Conflict Goals.

Any NPA damage the character has taken during the Scene, is currently being taken when they choose to Dramatically Escape, or that they take as a consequence of a Conflict Goal may be considered towards this cost if the player can contrive how those actions eject them from the scene.
