# What You Will Need
In addition to this handbook, you will need the following things to play a game using the Eternal Light engine:
## Players
Eternal Light is intended to function best for 2-5 players, either in-person or over online connection. Organizing 1-4 other players is an exercise left to the reader and should be completed before any other steps. Yes, including coming up with the game concept.
## Dice
Eternal Light uses 1 to 10 normal six-sided dice (D6s) for rolls. It's okay if you don't have 10, rolling 5 dice twice (or 2 dice 5 times) won't break anything.
## Playbooks
Each character in the Eternal Light system is built using a Playbook, a brief, character specific pamphlet detailing the archetype that character fits into, walking through character creation, and containing any character specific rules, as well as a convenient summary of rules and available actions.
# What You Can Use
The following are things the game can be played without, but may improve the game experience.
## Notes
It is recommended to have notecards, scratch paper, whiteboards, monitors, or other means of tracking Crises or Extras as they are introduced into a Scene or the Storyboard. Additionally, they may be useful for tracking secret information that has been discovered by players about a rival character.
## Character Tokens
While Eternal Light does not support maps, having character art is useful for establishing a character's identity, and a token can be useful for tracking which characters are present in a scene.
## Counters
AP and Distraction can both spend quickly enough that tracking by pencil can be troublesome. Having at least two colors of bead, stone, or other token to track this for physical pen and paper games may be a easier solution. A third color may be useful for tracking Power for rolls as it is gained, spent, or traded.
## Art
Providing art for characters, locations, or setting details can improve immersion and help players get on the same page picturing the scenario in play.
# What You Will Not Need
The following are things that Eternal Light was designed either to not need, or not support:
## Plots
Eternal Light is designed to empower players to take a direct role in shaping the story, scene, and setting both at the start of the game and during play. While this is intended in part to reduce the stress of GMing a session by delegating work towards the players, it also reduces the GM's control. In the process, the GM's ability to guide players into a structured narrative or predefined adventure may become an unfortunate casualty of the phrase, "No plan survives contact with the enemy."
## Maps
Eternal Light does not have the rules for supporting map-based movement, distancing, etc. A map may still be useful as artistic inspiration, as above.
