# Setting
An Eternal Light game should provide multiple choices of setting, or guidelines for guiding the players through the creation of a new setting. If it doesn't, remove this step.  
Either before or in parallel with character creation, the players will have to either choose a setting from the provided examples, or establish the base reality of a new setting:
* 1-4 major factions (empires/states, organized churches, corporations/guilds, etc.)
* Level of technology/magic/etc.
* Organization of society (Ex. Aristocratic, Communal, etc.)

This is necessary for both grounding the characters in the setting, as well as providing context for what sort of actions or failures would provoke different forms of Crisis. For example, a court scandal would be a significantly less disastrous affair in a modern-style democracy than under a monarchial regime, and would have to be approached in a far different manner.
# Characters
Additionally, players will have to build a Hero to play as. As above, this may be done after or concurrently with the creation of a setting. Each player may look through the playbooks for the game and choose one. Multiple players may use the same playbook, but it is recommended to have a variety of roles instead. Each playbook contains the core features of that character archetype, including Core Modules, Ability Tiers, Recovery, and Protection values. They also contain instructions for detailing the rest of the character, including Optional Modules, any starting Assets, their Objective in the story, and their Adversary. Once all players have chosen a Hero, they then proceed with Adversaries.
# Adversaries
The Adversaries are determined by the choices made when creating Heroes, and detailing each Adversary is the responsibility of the Nemesis for each Hero. The process is similar to creating a Hero, but using a playbook designated by the decisions made in the Hero's backstory. Once all of the Adversaries are created, the first Act can begin.
