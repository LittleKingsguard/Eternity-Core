# Organizing
If you have TTRPG experience and are familiar with all of the headings in this section, you may skip it. Otherwise, before any other setup can begin:
## Recruit
An Eternal Light game is intended to support 2-5 players and last for 1-4 sessions, depending on number of players and playstyle choices. Finding a group of players who can be available for the entire story is essential for an enjoyable, smoothly-running game.
## Choosing a Format
Eternal Light is agnostic about the format of the game, but is designed with the following options in mind:
### Table-Top
Players meet at a house or public space and play in-person, using physical dice and character sheets (or dice roller apps and sheets on a convenient screen.) Provides the easiest communication and group dynamics, but can be hard to schedule and may not work well for some introverted or quiet players.
### Online Voice/Video
Players log in to a voice chat app such as Discord. Dicerolling bots or dedicated game webapps like Roll20 or Foundry can provide character sheets and group-visible dice over the internet. Easier to schedule than in-person play while still enabling quick communication.
### Asynchronous Play-By-Post
Players use a chat app (again, ex. Discord), declaring their actions by text post and using dice-bots for rolls without expecting all players to be online or available at any one time. This may be optimal for more strategic games where players can think through their next action without the time pressure of other players actively waiting, but can result in the game becoming a greater total time commitment, if a relatively schedule-friendly one.
## Choosing a Style
Eternal Light is designed for both GM-centric and Troupe play, as detailed below. In either case, the GM or player controlling the Adversary for a Hero (or, for Adversary actions, the player controlling the opposing Hero) is referred to as the Nemesis by the rest of the rules in this book.
### Game Master
In this classic TTRPG format, one "player" controls all of the Adversaries, and any Minions involved in player-created Goals, acting as the Nemesis for all Heroes. Conversely, if an Adversary initiates a scene that the players decide they want to play out in full, any Goals created by the Adversary are detailed by the players, and any player whose Hero is not involved in the Scene (if any) controls any relevant Minions.
### Troupe
In place of a single player taking on a "Game Master" or "Umpire" role, all players share part of the responsibility. In addition to their Hero, each player will also control one other player's Adversary, and be responsible for detailing the challenges that other player faces as part of any Goals they declare in a Scene, or any relevant Minions.
