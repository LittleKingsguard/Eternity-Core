Characters are the primary drivers of Scenes and narrative events, as distinct from Minions, which cannot start Scenes or join them of their own accord. Each player should have at least one character, or more depending on the style of play. 

For classic GM-centric play, the GM controls the Adversaries as distinct characters, up to one for each player.
For troupe/table-style play, each player also controls one Adversary character.
