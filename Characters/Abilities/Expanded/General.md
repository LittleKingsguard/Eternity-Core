Expanded Abilities represent additional options that not every character has access to by default, but may be unlocked by taking a relevant Major Talent. Default examples include Wealth, Network, and Reputation, but this can also include genre-specific options such as schools of magic, cybernetics, hacking, genemods, and so on. An Expanded Ability cannot be used for a roll unless a relevant Talent is invoked as part of the Action.

If an Expanded Ability is chosen as the Primary Ability for a Scene, characters without that Ability may instead choose a relevant Ability from the Core options or any other Expanded Ability they possess. Conversely, if a character has appropriate Talents to complete or resist the declared Goals for a Scene based on an Expanded Ability, they may instead choose it instead of an originally declared Core Ability.
