A character's Abilities are their primary relevant statistics, and provide the starting values and caps for Dice and Power. Each Ability is a pair of ratings: Force, which provides Power, and Finesse, which provides Dice. Additionally, depending on playbook, characters have different Tiers assigned to each Ability.

Higher is better, and no Ability can be below 0. A character cannot raise any Ability above 5.
