A character's Persistence is their ability to persevere despite setbacks. While a character cannot use Persistence as the Primary Ability for an Action, is may always be the Secondary Ability.

The Action half corresponds to luck. While there are no Persistence Actions, a character with high ratings here might have their Persistence-Supported Actions narrated with convenient flukes of luck and chance, or, when expending PA, contrive seemingly-random coincidences or interference that aid them or foil an enemy's action.
The Effort half represents willpower and determination. A character with high ratings here might have their relevant actions described in terms of powering through adversity or "giving 110%".
