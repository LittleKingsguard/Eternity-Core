Social Abilities are additional Abilities that all humans (including Transhumans) have, but that robots may be unfamiliar with. Most robots are only familiar with one such Ability, and cannot start with ratings above 0 in the other two. To use any Social Ability, the robot must spend Comprehension, and may spend additional Comprehension in place of accepting Distraction for additional bonuses.

The Social Abilities are:
* Society
* Deception
* Empathy
