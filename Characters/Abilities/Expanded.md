Expanded Abilities are additional Abilities that may be specific to a single character, or represent some capability that they may not have universal access to, such as magic, extreme wealth, advanced technology, etc.

In addition to the traits of Core Abilities, Expanded Abiliities each have a specific resource (ex. mana for magic) that they must gain or expend in order to use the Ability.
