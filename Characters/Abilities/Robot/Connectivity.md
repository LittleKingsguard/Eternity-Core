Connectivity is the robot's ability to interface remotely with other technology over network connections. This may be impaired by a Scene having strong interference, capping the available Tier of use.

Tier 0 Connectivity is roughly what an experienced but unmodified human could do with a decent terminal and an Augmented Reality set.
Tier 1 is on par with dedicated network control systems, but capable of adapting to new technologies or penetrating firewalls on the fly.
Tier 2 exceeds any reasonable comparison except the largest of infrastructural projects, transmitting and consuming terabits of data per second from thousands or millions of sources simultaneously.
