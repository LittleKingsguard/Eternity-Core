Machinery represents the character's capacity to physically *do things*: navigating obstacles, construction or destruction, transport, combat, etc. If the character is not present in the Scene "in person" and controlling an external Body such as a Light/Heavy Utility Frame, the effective Tier of this Ability may be reduced to match the body's performance.

A Tier 0 Machinery ability places the character roughly human-level in overall performance.
Tier 1 Machinery is clearly superhuman, capable of feats of strength on par with heavy construction equipment and/or bullet-dodging speed
Tier 2 Machinery is the nearly sole dominion of advanced heavy frames, both so large and so strong that the question ceases to be "Can it be done?" but "Can we avoid collateral damage doing this?"
