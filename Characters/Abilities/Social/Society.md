Society covers the robot's understanding of social customs, culture, and local laws.  
A robot that has ratings in this ability can reasonably function in society unaided, though may still have issues with a local society that is simply not built to accomodate them. A 200-ton mech, for example, might know that the city it now lives in has a market economy and expects them to exchange money for their lubricants, and even have a job to pay for them, but also understand that it can't walk outside without tearing up the road.  
A robot that does *not* have ratings in this ability might perhaps *know* such things, in an abstract "downloaded and parsed the contents of the local legal library" sense, but struggle with the application and how the reality of day-to-day life differs from the on-paper ideal in ways that reflect human irrationality, or simply "common knowledge" that humans seem to just learn by osmosis from each other.
