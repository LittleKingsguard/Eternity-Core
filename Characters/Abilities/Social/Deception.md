Deception covers the character's ability to tell a convincing lie, and to recognize one when they hear it.  
A robot with ratings in Deception can competently bluff, and has enough experience with humans to understand not everything they say is wholly truthful. A seamless and coherent lie will typically require Society, Empathy, or Connectivity to acquire a believable foundation.  
A robot without ratings in Deception may have issues understanding falsehood (and especially *deliberate* falsehood) as a concept, and even more so as a possible option for themselves. Even when they do, their attempts vary from transparently implausible to unreasonably precise and will likely immediately make humans suspicious.
