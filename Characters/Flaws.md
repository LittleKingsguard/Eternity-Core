A character’s Flaws are the quirks, skill deficiencies, or persistent environmental factors that somehow contrive to hold them back from glory. 

A character must have at least one Flaw, but players may assign more if they wish. **Playing into a character’s Flaws is one of the common ways of giving them Ascension Tokens and Eternity Marks.**
