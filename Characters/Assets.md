Assets, unlike Talents, are less something a character is or knows, but more temporary things they currently possess or have working in their favor, such as equipment, favors, allies, special access, etc. Assets have a Dice/Power rating, which applies as a bonus to Actions using that Asset. They may also have traits that allow (or require) dice/power to be spent to activate certain effects. An Asset cannot have a higher bonus than 5/5.
