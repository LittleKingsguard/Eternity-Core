When a character starts or joins a Scene, the player may choose to train in the related Primary Ability, if they have initiated training for that Ability. While using that Scene for training, they may treat one of the Ability ratings as 1 point higher. By spending 1 Resources at the start of the Scene, they may instead choose to train both ratings at once, if they have both in-progress.

The character cannot train both an Ability and a Talent unless spending Resources on additional training.

Once the character has trained any single rating for four Scenes, the increased rating becomes permanent. They will have to initiate training again to continue increasing that rating.
