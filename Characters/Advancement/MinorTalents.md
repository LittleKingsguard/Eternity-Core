When a character starts or joins a Scene, the player may choose to train a Minor Talent relevant to the Scene and in-progress. While using that Scene for training, they may use that Talent. They may also select additional Talents for training by sepnding 1 Resources per extra Talent at the start of the Scene.

The character cannot train both an Ability and a Talent unless spending Resources on additional training.

Once the character has trained any single Talent for four Scenes, the increased rating becomes permanent.
