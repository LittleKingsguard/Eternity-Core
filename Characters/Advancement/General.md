To begin training to learn a new Talent or improve an Ability, the character must first introduce and complete a Scene Goal to establish the source of their new skills and the methods they use to learn them. This Goal must have a Difficulty equal to half the Action rating for the relevant Ability, a Resistance equal to the Effort rating of the relevant Ability, an amount of additional Agency/Impact invested equal to the number of known Minor Talents, and a Tier equal to the number of Major Talents for that Ability.
