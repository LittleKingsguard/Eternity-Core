At the start of each Act, a the player may nominate a Major Talent they have initiated for training. They may treat themselves as knowing that Talent for the duration of the Act. By spending 4 Resources each, they may declare additional Major Talents in different Abilities. A character cannot have more than one Major Talent initiated for training in a single Ability. If a character begins an Act with no Major Talents initiated for training, they may postpone this decision until they have initiated at least one.

If the associated Ability already has more Major Talents than any of the character's other Abilities, this must be trained for four Acts before it becomes permanent.
If it is instead tied for the most Major Talents, training completes after two Acts.
If it has 1 fewer Major Talents than the highest Ability, training completes after one Act.
If it has 2 fewer Major Talents than the highest Ability, it instead trains as a Minor Talent.
