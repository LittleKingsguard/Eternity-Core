A character's Abilities cannot be raised above 5 without a Transcendance effect active for that Ability. This effect is not a Talent and does not have to be learned separately, but it counts as a Major Talent for the purposes of training. It is counted as such for each Rating it is applied to, so a character with both ratings at 6 or above and no associated Major Talents will still esablish Training Goals at Tier II.
