A character has three Plot Armor tracks: Action, Scene, and Narrative. Each has a total size equal to the sum of both Ratings of the character' Heroics Ability, minus any adjustment from raising the Defense Tier. This cannot be made smaller than 2, or greater than 10. 

When Recovering, the character removes damage equal to the highest of the two Heroics ratings.
