A character's Plot Armor (PA) is a resource they can spend to avoid the consequences of losing all but the most severe Conflicts, escaping a Scene, or refreshing their Stress. Plot Armor cannot be regained once lost except by finishing the story. A character has a set amount of Plot Armor based on their playbook.
