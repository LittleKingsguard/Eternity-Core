Intimacies are a representation of the character’s emotional connections to the world, what they believe, and how they think. Intimacies have three traits: a subject (a person, place, concept, ideal, ambition, etc.), an emotional context (ex. Respect, love, hatred, devotion), and a strength (Major or Minor).

A Minor Intimacy represents something the character feels strongly enough about to take risks or sustain long-term goals over, and grants a +1 generic Bonus to all rolls made in line with that Intimacy, such as Reacting to defend a positive Intimacy, or Attacking a negative one. In Social conflict, it also applies to other characters’ Influence rolls that leverage that Intimacy. Both effects are cumulative.

A Major Intimacy represents something the character would be willing to risk everything for, including potentially giving their lives for if the situation was sufficiently desperate. It isntead gives a +2 generic Bonus to rolls, and additionally gives the character the option to make Saves on any roll in line with that Intimacy. In Social conflict, the Tier required to inflict damage is increased by 1 if the Influence runs counter to an existing Major Intimacy. However, if a hostile Influence action leverages a Major Intimacy, it is upgraded one Tier.

Finally, taking Actions or Scenes in line with any Intimacy despite the player understanding they are foolish, reckless, unnecessarily dangerous, or otherwise counterproductive to long-term goals is one of the primary ways of earning Ascension Tokens and Eternity Marks.

Invoking an Intimacy on a roll either by or against a character provides a Lead towards discovering that Intimacy. If the Intimacy is Major, leveraging the Intimacy is Overt for the purposes of discovering it.

A character must have at least one Major and one Minor Intimacy, but players may assign more if they wish. Playing into a character’s Intimacies is one of the common ways of giving them Ascension Tokens and Eternity Marks.

Design Notes:
As a general rule, all characters can be assumed to have a Major Intimacy for their own survival, which will be invoked against Social attempts to control them into suicidal decisions.
